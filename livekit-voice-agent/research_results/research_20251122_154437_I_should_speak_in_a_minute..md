**Query:** I should speak in a minute.
**Timestamp:** 2025-11-22T15:44:37.803675
**Summary:** The phrase "I'll be with you in a minute" typically indicates that the speaker is currently occupied but will attend to the listener shortly, often implying a brief wait rather than an exact minute. In the context of effective communication, particularly during networking or professional scenarios, the concept of a "one-minute talk" is essential for succinctly conveying one's identity and purpose, especially in settings like conferences. Additionally, the usage of casual requests such as "Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?" exemplifies how brief engagements can facilitate private discussions on sensitive matters. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of brevity and clarity in communication across various contexts, from casual conversations to professional interactions.

**Question:**
What does this mean: "I'll be with you in a minute"?

**Answer:**
Well usually this is used when speaking face-to-face, and is taken to mean```
I'm occupied right now, and I'll speak to you in some (short period of) time. 
```Not exactly one minute, but a short enough time. Similar usage to "Just a second" or "Gimme a sec"If on the phone, it should probably mean he'll call back after a minute or so.Updated:As @Martha says - On the phone, this would likely mean *you should hold*.
The correct statement if he intends to ring you back would be```
"I'll get back to you in a minute". 
```

Preparing and giving a one minute speech can be just the trick for learning to communicate efficiently and effectively. With only one minute to speak about any topic under the sun, every word you say counts. Your professor may use this method as a fun way to help you practice your communication skills, more specifically your ability to think on your toes, express a point of view, captivate an audience and become comfortable speaking in public. Take a look at 6 of the best samples of 1 minute speeches below:

- **Jim Carrey.** A small sample from this commencement address shows an excellent combination of elements that make for a great speech. Not only does he speak generally about motivation and following dreams, he uses personal examples and stories that truly engage listeners. Kudos Jim!

- **Steve Jobs.** In a moving one minute motivational speech, Steve Jobs explores why we should love what we do. He urges his listeners to follow their heart.

- **Nick Vujicic.** This inspiring speaker urges his audience to do more than they believe is possible. Many people if faced with Vujicic’s physical disabilities might give up, but Vujicic reminds us not to say “I can’t do it”, but “How can I do it?” This is a great example of someone speaking from the heart – one of the keys to success in a one minute speech.

- **Ronald Reagan.** After the Challenger explosion, Reagan addressed the nation with a beautiful speech to lead the nation after this very saddening event. Although short, this speech acknowledges the mourning of a nation. Reagan showed his humanity and strength to a nation who needed a leader.

- **Rocky Balboa.** Even movie characters have great speeches. This “up and at ’em” inspirational speech that Balboa gives to his son in the movie is spot on. It’s to the point and makes you want to get up and fight for what you want. This speech inspires action. It’s raw and real with a great metaphor to capture his son’s attention (note – speech begins at minute 2:00 in the video).

- **Josh Light.** This quick speech known as an “elevator pitch” used to propose a business idea to potential clients is very engaging and easy to follow. This is an important kind of a speech to master, as most of us have to explain our professional work at some point or another. Notice the movement and engaging body language used to captivate the audience.

Use these great examples to find inspiration for your own one minute speech. As in all of these examples, speaking about an issue that is important to you and speaking from the heart are two of the most important elements. Get started practicing your speech today!

# The One-Minute Talk

- 13 Mar 2009

- By Victoria McGovern

When someone asks you who you are and what you do--whether it's a random stranger on a conference elevator (who may just end up being your next boss), or a Nobel Prize–winner sitting next to you at dinner after an on-campus lecture--your answer needs to be clear, crisp, accurate, interesting, informative, pleasant, friendly, optimistic, articulate, and succinct all in a single, relaxed burst of speech measured in seconds, not minutes. You need to say all the things you mean to say without going off course; rambling; giggling; stumbling over your words; speaking to your navel instead of the person you're supposed to be addressing; mocking yourself; inadvertently insulting the person you're meeting or his or her place of employment, country, family, or favorite athletic team; spilling your coffee; forgetting to breathe; apologizing for being unworthy; or stating unequivocally that your scientific work is irrelevant, small, and likely to burst into flames at any moment.

What if you spill your water on the other person? Just apologize and hand over your napkin.

When you introduce yourself, you must give a tiny talk, full of facts about yourself and your work without forgetting that the entire moment is about not you, but, rather, this person to whom you are speaking.

## Only a moment

When it's time to introduce yourself, you typically get only a moment. At that moment, all eyes are on you. How do you make the most of your moment? Or, at least, how can you avoid embarrassing yourself or making your science seem dull, trivial, inane, or wrong?

With a little forethought, you can become more confident at delivering the "1-minute talk." That's good, because over the next few years you will find yourself giving this talk over and over again, to peers and senior scientists at meetings, to seminar speakers who have come to visit your institution, to visiting dignitaries or new recruits you may be asked to shepherd from place to place. And if you manage to hang on and establish a career in science--and probably even if you don't--you'll give versions of this talk hundreds, maybe thousands of times over the next 30 to 40 years.

## Who, what, why, and why

When you meet someone new in a professional context, your goal should be to communicate four things: who you are, what you do, why you're meeting them, and most of all, why they should care that they are meeting you. A little reflection will help you develop your opening lines and find natural answers to these four questions. Thinking about the particular words you will use to start these tiny talks will help you be more at ease in professional conversations. Then, once you've got those answers mapped out, try them out at every opportunity. Seek out strangers in scientific settings and practice. A little practice can make a tremendous difference on the type of impression you make and how lasting it is. And that can make a big difference in your professional life.

The personal introduction is a tiny speech, but it's more than that; it's an exercise in fulfilling expectations. Your 1-minute talk is part of a common transaction, which, just like a knock-knock joke or a waltz, has an expected rhythm that leads both participants through the ever-changing terrain of the exchange. In science, you're likely to find yourself, more often than not, conversing with someone who'd rather be writing code, plating gels, or hiding in the bathroom. You can win points by keeping to that expected rhythm, allowing your partner-in-conversation to remain comfortable and at ease--or as comfortable and at ease as it is possible for them to be.

## The seminar lunch

The seminar lunch is one important occasion during which you can practice giving your 1-minute speech. There you sit at a table full of napkins, water glasses, menus, and other obstacles, with The Biggest Person in Your Field or a Nobel Prize–winner seated to your left. The group sits and pleasantries are exchanged: "This seems like a nice place." Or "How was your flight into town?" Menus are fiddled with; a waiter appears; drinks are served. Some members of the group cower behind menus; others look out the window; some guzzle caffeine; at least one is furtively fingering a BlackBerry under the table. The speaker, who seems comparatively approachable, turns to you. She looks you in the eye and starts the show: "So what are you working on?"

What do you do? First, relax. No matter how important the guest is, he or she is just a person. Trite as it may sound, that observation is a key to becoming comfortable around intimidating people and allowing them to be comfortable, too. Be calm. Take a moment to think through what you want to say. The story you tell should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Who are you? What do you do? Why are you here? Why should the person you're speaking to care?

Breathe, then start talking. Say your name clearly and indicate your status--student, postdoc, whatever. Mention what lab you work in. Then frame your work with the big picture: what you're interested in, how you approach it, and how it got you an invite to this lunch. Look the other person in the eye as you speak. If the angle is bad, pull out your chair slightly so that you can address Nobel Laureate face-on. Don't glare like a vulture, just make eye contact--"check in" often to see if his face registers understanding, engagement, or a strong desire to ask a question. Pause if there seems to be a question brewing. Finish up by connecting what you've said back to the guest's interests or work. When you're done, stop talking and smile a natural smile. The guest might ask a question or just nod and shift his or her glance to the next person at the table, indicating that it's time for them to give their own introductions. You're off the hot seat.

But what if things go wrong? What if you spill your water on the other person? Just apologize and hand over your napkin. What if the speaker turns to you just as you unhinge your jaw and commit wholeheartedly to an ear of corn? Just as you would at a big family dinner, raise your eyebrows, shrug your shoulders, and shift your eyes toward the person sitting next to you--the international signal for "skip me and come back when I don't have my mouth full."

What if you say your name incorrectly, forget where you work or what you work on, or can't even bring yourself to speak? It happens. Relax. Bobbling the 1-minute speech is rarely fatal. If you start speaking and nothing comes out right, it's fine to acknowledge that you're nervous and start over. It's just us humans here, so focus, relax, breathe, and make sure that you keep the second try short. Smile. Look 'em in the eye. Be confident that you know yourself and your science, and begin to speak.

## “Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?”

One of the other members of your softball team made a joke that offended you. You don't embarrass him in front of the whole team, so after practice you ask him to talk privately with you.

Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

### Hey

You say "Hey" at the beginning of a sentence in casual English when you want to get someone's attention. For example:

Hey, Hitomi, can you hand me that box over there?

It's common to say "Hey" before you ask someone a question, or when someone has done something that's wrong or unfair:

Hey, you're taking up the whole bed!

Use "hey" with people you know or are familiar with. When you're talking to people you don't know as well, "Excuse me" is more polite.

### Can I talk to you?

When you have to talk to someone about a serious, and maybe uncomfortable, topic, it's good to start by saying:

Can I talk to you?

This phrase alerts the listener that you're not just making small talk; you have something serious about. Here are some examples of conversations that you may want to start by saying "Can I talk to you?":

- You need to reprimand one of your employees for doing something wrong.

- You just got some bad news, and you need to share it with your partner.

- You're going to break up with the person you've been dating.

If you want to make this expression a little bit less serious (but still pretty serious), add "for a minute" or "for a second".

To make it more formal, use "May I", "speak with", and "for a moment" instead:

Jessica, may I speak with you for just a moment?

# English Phrases – Could I have a word with you? / Do you have a moment?

For example, in a meeting at work with your colleagues, and you want to talk with just one person from the group alone, privately without the other people listening. So the question “could I have a word with you” is a polite and indirect way to express to that person that you want to talk to him/her privately, away from the other people.

A similar question for asking to talk with somebody is this: “Do you have a moment?” “Do you have a moment?” is more frequently used when you’re just talking to one person. For example, you called a person on the phone, or you went to your co-workers office to visit them, and “do you have a moment?” is a way to ask if the other person has time to talk with you, if they are available and not busy. So, “do you have a moment?” is a way to respect that person’s time.

The person might answer “Yes, of course,” and then you can continue the conversation; or the person might answer “I’m a little bit busy” and in that case, you’d have to wait until later to speak with that person.

Now, some students ask me the difference between talk to, talk with, speak to, and speak with, and in this case, there really isn’t any difference between them. So you could say “Could I speak with you for a minute?” – that’s also possible, but I think the most common way to say it is “could I talk to you for a minute”.

So now you know 3 ways to ask to speak with someone else: “Could I have a word with you?” for asking to speak with someone privately, and get them away from a group, “Do you have a moment?” as a way to ask about the other persons availability for a conversation, and the most informal phrase, “Could I talk to you for a minute?” which you could use among friends.

**Answer:**
@shalomAti i have never heard anyone say the first 3, but they all mean the same thing, for a minute is when you want to have a talk to someone for slightly longer than “for a sec”, out of the 3 bottom ones i would say that:in a casual conversation, “for a second” is the most commonin the workplace or business related you’d use “for a moment”and i usually hear “for a minute” or “for a quick minute” when someone is in trouble lol

**Question:**
How should I ask politely for a moment of someone's time?

**Answer:**
When I want to interrupt someone in front of me I would say:> Verzeihung, haben Sie bitte mal einen Moment Zeit?or> Entschuldigung, darf ich Sie mal stören?The leading word (not important which one you choose) gets attention to the question itself. To make the question polite, it's important to give it a polite pronunciation. I would not tell the guy that he's busy, he knows it himself.

**Title:** Quote Origin: If I Am To Speak Ten Minutes, I Need a Week for Preparation; If an Hour, I Am Ready Now – Quote Investigator®

Woodrow Wilson? Abraham Lincoln? Rufus Choate? Thomas B. Macaulay? William Howard Taft? Mark Twain? Anonymous?

Question for Quote Investigator: A biography of President Woodrow Wilson included an entertaining quotation about the preparation time needed for speeches of varying lengths. Here is an excerpt from the book:1

A member of the Cabinet congratulated Wilson on introducing the vogue of short speeches and asked him about the time it took him to prepare his speeches. He said:

“It depends. If I am to speak ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready now.”

This biography was published in 1946, i.e., many years after the death of Wilson in 1924. Could you search for earlier support of this quotation?

Reply from Quote Investigator: QI has located a match for a close variant quotation in 1918 that was attributed to Woodrow Wilson. The details are given further below.

There is a family of statements expressing this central idea, and it has been evolving for more than one hundred years. Tracing this family is difficult because of the high variability of the wording.

The first relevant instance found by QI was spoken in 1893 by the Governor of California. He ascribed the words to Abraham Lincoln, but this linkage was weak because Lincoln died decades earlier in 1865.This rudimentary version mentioned two different speech lengths instead of four:2

Lincoln once made a most apt suggestion applicable to such cases. When asked to appear upon some important occasion and deliver a five-minute speech, he said that he had no time to prepare five-minute speeches, but that he could go and speak an hour at any time.

In 1895 a minister named J. N. Hall gave a speech at a meeting of the Men’s Sunday Evening Club as reported in a Rockford, Illinois newspaper. Hall ascribed an instance of the saying to Rufus Choate who was an orator and Senator from Massachusetts who died decades earlier in 1859. This version was tripartite; however, the third part referred to talking all day instead of speaking for an hour:3

There is a great deal in condensation in these days of compressed yeast and potted ham, and I am reminded of an incident told of Rufus Choate, who being asked to make a speech on a certain occasion said, “If it is to be a minute speech I shall need four weeks in which to prepare, if a half hour speech, then two weeks, but if I am to talk all day I’m ready now.”

The QI website also has an entry for a popular related quotation: “If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter”. Here is a link.

Here are additional selected citations in chronological order.

In 1900 a doctor employed an instance of the schema while speaking at a convention of the New Hampshire Medical Society. The crafter of the statement was unidentified:4

Discussion opened by H. L. Stickney, M.D. of Newport. Mr. President and Fellows:

Some one has said that “if you want me to speak two minutes you give me a notification of two weeks; if you want me to speak five minutes, I should have a notification of one week, but if you want me to talk all day, here I am.”

In 1915 a textbook chapter titled “The Art of Public Speaking” by Grenville Kleiser presented an instance of the expression with an anonymous ascription:5

A man should take ample time in which properly to prepare his speech. “How long do you wish me to speak?” asked a man who was invited by a society to attend its annual dinner. “Why do you ask?” inquired the secretary. “Because,” said the orator, “if you want me to give a ten-minute address I must have at least two weeks in which to prepare myself, but if you want me to talk for an hour or more, I am ready.”

In 1918 the saying was attributed to President Woodrow Wilson in the pages of a trade publication for the flour milling industry. The third part of this version used the phrase “talk as long as I want” instead of “an hour”:6

“How long does it take you to prepare one of your speeches?” asked a friend of President Wilson not long ago.

“That depends on the length of the speech,” answered the President. “If it is a ten-minute speech it takes me all of two weeks to prepare it; if it is a half-hour speech it takes me a week; if I can talk as long as I want to it requires no preparation at all. I am ready now.”

In 1922 a textbook titled “Public Speaking Today: A High School Manual” included a variant of the expression which was attributed to Thomas Babington Macaulay, a British statesman and historian who died in 1859:7

“It takes longer,” says Professor Alden in his Art of Debate, “to prepare a short speech than a long one on almost any subject.” It takes longer to round out a fifteen-minute speech than one an hour long on the same subject. “How long does it take you to work up your speeches?” Macaulay was asked. “That depends,” he replied, “on the length of the speech; if it is a two-hour speech I can prepare it in two days; if it is an hour speech, two weeks; but if it is a ten-minute speech it takes two months.” In the short speech every word must count.

Also in 1922 a college fraternity publication reported on an interfraternity dinner held in Chicago. A speaker stated that a professor he knew had employed a variant of the expression:8

…that reminds me of a professor that I knew in college in that very much over praised institution that you have heard about here tonight; the boys used to go to him frequently and ask him to address the class of Umpty-ump, or the Wearers of the C, or some other distinguished gathering, and he used to say to them, “Well, now, if you want me to talk fifteen minutes, I must have two weeks to prepare; if you want me to talk half an hour, why I can get along with one week; but if I can talk about the Elmira Reformatory and talk as long as I want to, I am ready now.”

In 1931 “The Rotarian” magazine printed a variant with a reverse ordering. The longest speech length was mentioned first:9

Some wise speaker once said that if he had fifteen minutes to prepare, he could speak two hours; if he had a day, he could speak an hour; but that if he had two weeks in which to prepare he could make his speech in fifteen minutes.

In 1938 a humor column called “In Lighter Vein” of the “Christian Science Monitor” newspaper printed an instance with an attribution to Woodrow Wilson that closely matched the text of the 1918 citation:10

The Longer the Quicker

“How long does it take you to prepare one of your speeches?” asked a friend of President Wilson.

“That depends on the length of the speech,” answered the President. “If it is a 10-minute speech, it takes me all of two weeks to prepare it; if it is a half hour speech, it takes me a week; if I can talk as long as I want to, it requires no preparation at all. I am ready now.”

In 1943 the “Boston Herald” of Massachusetts printed a version that was closer to the modern version ascribed to Wilson. The third part mentioned a two-hour speech instead of a speech of unlimited duration:11

Someone once asked Woodrow Wilson how long it took him to prepare for a ten-minute speech. He said, “Two weeks.” “How long for an hour speech?” “One week,” he answered. “And for a two-hour one?” his interrogator went on, “I am ready now,” replied the late president.

In 1948 a biography titled “The Wilson Era: Years of War and After 1917-1923” included an instance of the saying credited to Wilson as mentioned previously by the questioner:12

The above citation appears in three key reference works: “Respectfully Quoted” (1989),13 “Cassell’s Humorous Quotations” (2001),14 and “The Yale Book of Quotations” (2006).15

In 1985 the “New York Times” published remarks by a diplomat named Andor C. Klay who presented an anecdote featuring President William Howard Taft:16

Kohanyi requested President William Howard Taft to attend the 20th anniversary banquet of Szabadsag and make a speech there: “Just a brief one, Mr. President, since we can imagine how busy you must be – perhaps five minutes.” The President smiled and declined: “Do you realize my friends, that to prepare even a five-minute speech would take several hours to plan, to draft, to rewrite, to pass through channels for clearances? I’m afraid that I just haven’t got the time.”

Kohanyi pressed: “Well, as far as that goes, we would be delighted to have you speak for an hour.” The monumental body of the heaviest statesman of his time straightened up: “Gentlemen, I am ready, now!”

By 1998 a version of the saying had been connected to the popular humorist Mark Twain on the website of a company providing assistance to public speakers:17

In fact, Mark Twain is one of the earliest known professional speakers and when asked one day if he could prepare a speech for an upcoming engagement, he responded ,”If you want me to speak for an hour, I am ready today.” “If you want me to speak for just a few minutes, it will take me a few weeks to prepare.”

In conclusion, QI believes that Woodrow Wilson probably did employ an instance of this expression. However, the family of sayings had already been established a couple decades before the first ascription to Wilson was published. Wilson was from an academic milieu and the 1922 citation in a fraternity periodical suggested that the saying was in circulation within academia. QI hypothesizes that Wilson was using a pre-existing template.

The attributions to Abraham Lincoln, Rufus Choate, and Mark Twain were all very weak because they occurred many years after the death of the named individuals.

The evolution of this family of sayings does not point to a single authorship, and QI would label the set anonymous.

**Question:**
Anyone notice the many times in the show that 2 people need to talk in private. They just maybe take 2/3 steps away and start talking. Like everyone in the room or the people they left can't still hear them lol I know its a fake sitcom but it always makes me laugh.Plus if someone is on the phone and don't want the other person on the end of the line to hear, they just lower the phone to their belly or hold it against their shoulder lol Pretty sure they would block out the sound very little.

**Answer:**
This always gives me a chuckle. You’d think there’s an invisible sound barrier dividing the kitchen and living room given all the “private” conversations they’ve had.
