**Source:** web

**Content:**
**Question:**
I'm looking for ideas to make a rippling water lighting effect at a small scale (5v USB driven.) I am making a practical effects prop that, depending on what button is pressed on a remote control, makes an elemental light/sound display. For example, if I press the flame button, it will do the following:1. turn on orange flame bulb behind some charred logs
2. turn on ultrasonic mister to create "flame" and smoke
3. turn on red slow-pulse LEDs to mimic embers
4. play a fire sound effectI'm looking for a way to make a water effect. So far my idea is to do the following:1. coat polycarbonate tubes in mirror film. Fill with water. When the button is pressed, turn on a USB air stone and blue lights in the tube to create bubble columns.
2. play a trickling water sound effect
3. turn on an ultrasonic mister aimed low and horizontal to make mist "across the water."
4. do some sort of lighting effect to create ripples against the wall.That fourth part is giving me some trouble. I tried aqua and white pulsing LEDs inside a crackle glass sphere. It looked really cool, but not like water. I tried aiming an LED through a petri dish filled with water but it didn't do much. I suspect I need special glass? I tried replacing a "disco light" with blue LEDs but it just looked like a blue light show.I'm looking for an effect like the ones below, but without a huge projector and a smaller form factor than the lamp. If you have any ideas please pass them on. Thanks![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q9Bop2gvlE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q9Bop2gvlE) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx_8K2UIAT8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx_8K2UIAT8)

**Answer:**
Use a small computer fan (DC powered) to blow across the surface of the water-filled petri dish. That will create the movement you need to sell the water effect.

Does the ripple effects come from single metal halide bulb unlike fluos which run along the tank? I am using NO on my nano but hardly see any ripple effect but the giant fish tank in the LFS has got huge underwater ripple shadow effect when they are using metal halides. I know it has got nothing to do with brightness but the angles of a single metal halide bulbs compare to NO fluos running along the tank is that true?

i only have fw experience, but; i was playing with an old hid light over my tank once, and it does cause this ripple effect you are asking about. the hob's agitated the water surface and the light which was hanging over the middle of the tank created a rippling effect and vivid shadows from the plants and fish alike. hth.

I am not very good at describing physic and no degree in physics but correct me if I am wrong. With fluos it is running across the top of tank, therefore all the light shown will shoot down to the botton vertically from the left to the right therefore render water surface ripple effect useless. Whereas with one metal halide, say you only got a single bulb in the middle of the tank, the light shoot to the left side and right side of the tank will be at a certain degree of angle therefore the ripple on the water surface will cause ripple shadow effect underneath the water surface on either side only I think because the middle of the tank will have the metal halide right on top and will not have that much ripple effect. But if you use twin metal halide this spots can be covered by both metal halide angle and you get the total ripple effect full area under the water surface. Don't know if this make sense to everyone I am not a native english speaker.

I only have 2x 3ft NO and I do get a ripple effect but not as intense as MH. Actually when the lights turn off and there's just the light from just the fixtures in the room I get a much more dramatic result, and they're a good couple of meters away..

I think fluo won't give much ripple effect strip light that is. For max ripple effect I will say a few single bulb light, not necessary a metal halide but something like a single bulb in nature spread them out and you still get ripple effect but metal halide just show them up more obviously because it is brighter I think.

I still don't know what you guys mean by angle. You have a mh bulb mounted horizontally or a flourescent bulb mounted horizontally so what diff angles are you talking about? The ripples you see in the tank are actually shadows cast by the water surface, if thats what you guys are talking about. That comes from the intensity of a mh. Flourescents just are not bright or intense enough to cast a shadow that far into the water.

cccapt is correct. What you guys are talking about can not be accomplished with PCs, VHOs, NOs or HOs, they just do not have the intensity needed to create the shadows. What are you are talking about the lamps and other lights you have that cause a ripple when you lights are off are because your lights are off. The NOs you are using cancel out the light from your lamps or other lights when they are on. If you want to create the ripple effect you need to upgrade to MH w/VHO actinics.

MH lights like / \ and fluro like | | | | so therefore halides create angle try this at night with a small torch and you will see amazing rippes its because of the angle.

Hmmmmmm So are you trying to say light coming out of a round tube flourescent bulb directs the light ONLY in one direction? Down? So if I look at the side of the bulb there's no light coming out? Interesting. How do you know which way is right side up before you turn it on? You wouldn't want the light shing up only. On every flourescent bulb I've ever seen, the light comes out from all 360 degrees. Some reef bulbs have a reflective coating over the top half to reflect more light down, but it still comes from the sides too. And your diagram shows a mh doesn't shine directly down? I must have special bulbs then, cause mine sure do shine down, and up, and sideways..in fact light comes out of a round, horizontally mounted mh bulb from all 360 degrees. Forget your angle theory It's all about the intensity.

I have no idea what he is talking about. I'm with you cccapt, my bulbs shine in all directions that's the point of a reflector, to get as much of the light to go in the direction you want, usually straight down. Oh well......

Whereas with one metal halide, say you only got a single bulb in the middle of the tank, the light shoot to the left side and right side of the tank will be at a certain degree of angle therefore the ripple on the water surface will cause ripple shadow effect underneath the water surface on either side only I think because the middle of the tank will have the metal halide right on top and will not have that much ripple effect. But if you use twin metal halide this spots can be covered by both metal halide angle and you get the total ripple effect full area under the water surface. Don't know if this make sense to everyone I am not a native english speaker.

- Apple Motion Help with water rippling effect Posted by Lynette Gilbert on March 1, 2008 at 3:51 pm I am trying to do an “underwater” themed project in Motion. I am having a hard time figuring out how to make a water rippling effect, both for the background and for the text. Is there a plug-in I can get, or can I manipulate one of the basic behavior/particles? I have tried doing the text in LiveType, but I still can’t find quite the right animation. What I am exactly trying to do is have rippling water out of which the text will fade in a kind of ripple. Any help will be much appreciated.

Any help will be much appreciated.

It took me longer to type up what follows than it took me to find it. Open up the Library tab in the Motion browser, type “ripple” in the search field, then click on “Filters”, you should see 2 filters to choose from. Now click on “Particle Emiters”, you should see an emiter. Also, if you open up the manual & search for “ripple”, you’ll find one or 2 other options.

- Burt Hazard March 1, 2008 at 7:09 pm Actually pretty easy to do in Motion, although for a really good effect you may need to use many layers. Underwater effects tend to need several things, refraction, caustics, greenish/blusish colorations, an overall diffuse glow, blurred elements in the distance, and maybe even bubbles! Actually refraction and “caustics” (the shimmering light patterns found on the bottom of swimming pools) are related to the way light refracts and focuses through a water medium. For the refraction displacement effect you can use Filter>Distortion>Underwater (you also have “Ripple,” “Refraction,” etc. choices as well). I’d bring down the Refraction and Speed parameters in the Inspector. You could use the Generator>Caustics preset and Stencil Luma it to your text. You could then add Blur/Bloom filters to objects in the distance, as well as a tinted plate(s) and particle emitter bubble streams in the foreground. Good luck, Burt Hazard Munedawg Communications

- Lynette Gilbert March 2, 2008 at 5:11 am Thank you, Burt, for your actual help. I’m a videographer and editor, not an animator, so I’ve never used an animation program to any extent. I am trying to learn Motion in a relatively short amount of time and not have it end up looking like a total amateur created it. I do appreciate your positive feedback. I will try your advice next week when I get back to work. Unfortunately, I don’t have Motion at home so I can’t experiment now. Again, thanks for reaching out to an animation beginner and offering encouragement, not sarcasm.

### Rippling light through water effects

by [Guessmyname](https://www.interlopers.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=670&sid=f01577bbfaa60428ad83cb788e261b48)

I'm trying to make a light-rippling-through-water effect, where, well, light is going through water and being distorted, creating rippling highlights and shadows on the ground. It's a considerable problem to implement though, being basically animated light. I suspect the best / possibly only real way of doing this would be using an animated texture with env_projected texture... does anyone know if this is even possible? The other problem being this would be very expensive to use. If there are any other alternatives, that would also be grand. Animated cubemaps could work, but would require specialised mapping, textures and wouldn't really give you any shadows. Potentially, animated additive decals could also be used in some cases, but only if, say, illuminating a wall or floor singularly, and nothing else. A bit like a cheaper version of the env_projectedtexture method above, but again - no shadows. It's a tricky thing to try and do... any suggestions?

I'm guessing you mean caustics. You could search for a simple texture online or make your own. Once you do, make a material file with the additive property and two texture scrolling proxies and make it so they scroll against each other. Then you have a choice. You could do something like use overlays and turn texturelock off to cover your underwater area but I'd personally export the piece of the map to .dxf and create a model which is 1 unit off of the map's geometry and UV it so the texture stretches at the side like real life. That'd be pretty cool. You now have me day-dreaming. [http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/ ... stics.html](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/INRIA/caustics.html) Perfect for textures.

Basically, wrong engine, unless you're going to code like a lunatic. I think I know where this is all going, and I'd love to see it work, but it'd be hideously complicated to do in Source. You've used all of my suggestions anyway

Srred, I believe, did an effect like this a while ago. He used an animated texture, alpha blended to whatever he needed it 'cast' onto.

there was a map in battlegrounds (the hl1 version) that had this effect in a cave. i think the rock texture was just animated with the static background and this effect overlayed on each frame.

Unless I'm mistaken, it means this: Rather than this: Otherwise it'd be a cheap overlay.

Well, you can make the streaming effect with an animated volume-light model. But I think he means cast thru a window onto walls/floors/etc, right?

either one of those effects could be done with an animated texture. It would not be the easiest thing in the world to do, but I member a map back in CS 1.6 having that effect. For the life of me I can not remember the map name, but I do know it was done with animated textures or more accurately as tictac suggested with a model which uses said animated texture.

I'm just gonna speak for Srred again He told me that he used an alphablend texture on the rock, but that would require you use displacements for everything you want this 'cast' onto. Best bet might be to make an animated overlay in various generic shapes (such as a small one for a window, or a large one for a skylight). If that doesn't work out, then jump into the mods code and enable a few more dynamic lights (projected textures) and use them *sparingly*.

### Rippling light through water effects

by [Guessmyname](https://www.interlopers.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=670&sid=f01577bbfaa60428ad83cb788e261b48)

I'm trying to make a light-rippling-through-water effect, where, well, light is going through water and being distorted, creating rippling highlights and shadows on the ground. It's a considerable problem to implement though, being basically animated light. I suspect the best / possibly only real way of doing this would be using an animated texture with env_projected texture... does anyone know if this is even possible? The other problem being this would be very expensive to use. If there are any other alternatives, that would also be grand. Animated cubemaps could work, but would require specialised mapping, textures and wouldn't really give you any shadows. Potentially, animated additive decals could also be used in some cases, but only if, say, illuminating a wall or floor singularly, and nothing else. A bit like a cheaper version of the env_projectedtexture method above, but again - no shadows. It's a tricky thing to try and do... any suggestions?

I'm guessing you mean caustics. You could search for a simple texture online or make your own. Once you do, make a material file with the additive property and two texture scrolling proxies and make it so they scroll against each other. Then you have a choice. You could do something like use overlays and turn texturelock off to cover your underwater area but I'd personally export the piece of the map to .dxf and create a model which is 1 unit off of the map's geometry and UV it so the texture stretches at the side like real life. That'd be pretty cool. You now have me day-dreaming. [http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/ ... stics.html](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/INRIA/caustics.html) Perfect for textures.

Basically, wrong engine, unless you're going to code like a lunatic. I think I know where this is all going, and I'd love to see it work, but it'd be hideously complicated to do in Source. You've used all of my suggestions anyway

Srred, I believe, did an effect like this a while ago. He used an animated texture, alpha blended to whatever he needed it 'cast' onto.

there was a map in battlegrounds (the hl1 version) that had this effect in a cave. i think the rock texture was just animated with the static background and this effect overlayed on each frame.

Well, you can make the streaming effect with an animated volume-light model. But I think he means cast thru a window onto walls/floors/etc, right?

either one of those effects could be done with an animated texture. It would not be the easiest thing in the world to do, but I member a map back in CS 1.6 having that effect. For the life of me I can not remember the map name, but I do know it was done with animated textures or more accurately as tictac suggested with a model which uses said animated texture.

Eye Doctor: CornelioT

Welcome to JustAnswer; my name is***** am a board-certified doctor with 10 years of experience, I am here to help you today!

I will be with you in a few minutes, I am just digesting your question and tailoring a suitable response. If you have any additional information for me in the meantime, please let me know.

I am so sorry and I greatly value your patience, let me help you.

It sounds like you might be experiencing what's known as "visual snow," where you see a flickering or shimmering effect similar to rippling water.

This can sometimes happen due to various factors such as migraines, eye strain, or even as a standalone visual phenomenon.

Take breaks from screens, do gentle eye exercises, stay hydrated, adjust lighting to reduce glare, and practice stress management.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

My thoughts are with you. :)

Take care and have a great day.

# I see something like rippling water effect in my vision on peripheral and when i close my eyes i see wavy yellowish

I notice a rippling water effect in my peripheral vision, and when I close my eyes, I see wavy yellowish lines. This happens all the time; what could it be?

25,321 satisfied customers

Another thing, I notice haziness, and when I close my eyes, I see bright and shimmering spots in the corners of my eyes.

Eye Doctor: Dr. Rick

Hello. I am a medical professional with twenty years of experience in ophthalmology and retina surgery. I am available online and ready to address your question today.

Is this occurring in both eyes?

What is the duration of this condition?

Is your vision impacted?

Are there any additional symptoms?

Do you have any other medical conditions or are you currently taking any medications?

This is not a response, but rather an Information Request. I require this information to provide an answer to your question. Please respond, so I can assist you further. I look forward to helping you.

Hello, Doctor. It began in my left eye and has now affected both eyes; it's constant, 24/7. I experience unusual double vision, where it’s not just double but appears as 6 or 7 images with light sources and 4 images with other objects. Additionally, I see millions of tiny black dots, which are more noticeable against a white wall. I have sinus issues, and I will attach my report. Recently, after an MRI, they suspect I have idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), and I have been on acetazolamide for about two weeks now.

I would not hastily diagnose you with pseudotumor cerebri unless there is evidence of optic nerve swelling and elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture, with or without visual field changes.

If this assessment was not conducted prior to starting you on diamox, I would recommend seeking a second opinion.

Your visual symptoms resemble a migraine aura, but they do not persist continuously as yours seems to.

So, what should be done?

I would suggest scheduling a consultation with a neuro-ophthalmologist.

Does this make sense to you?

I am glad to assist you today. If you could kindly help me receive credit for my efforts in addressing your questions by pressing the excellent feedback button for this encounter, I would appreciate it. Also, please remember that I work for tips. I would be more than happy to continue answering any further questions you may have until we resolve your concern.

**Answer:**
Heat haze. Convection between you and your subject is altering the index of refraction of the trasmission medium (air), causing the ripples.

Hello

For the past 10 minutes, my left eye has been experiencing a "ripple" effect in my vision. While my straight-ahead vision is clear, my vision to the left resembles a pool of water where someone has thrown a pebble, causing a constant "ripple." It is not painful, but it appeared suddenly.

Eye Doctor: Dr. Dan B.

Hello and thank you for your question.

Have you or anyone in your family experienced a history of migraine headaches?

Did you experience motion sickness as a child?

Are there any headaches, nausea, or sensitivity to light or loud noises associated with this?

I experienced a severe migraine that required hospitalization while I was pregnant with my fourth child. I still tend to get car sick easily when I'm a passenger. There are no headaches or anything similar. Recently, I've noticed another unusual symptom: for the past couple of months, I've been able to smell cigarette smoke even though no one is smoking nearby!

Believe it or not, your symptoms appear to align with a migraine phenomenon known as an acephalgic migraine, or migraine without the headache. It is quite common for individuals with a history of migraine headaches to experience a change in the nature of their migraines, including the development of visual phenomena without the accompanying headache. I've encountered patients as old as 75 who, after decades without a migraine, suddenly begin to experience these acephalgic migraines; this can certainly lead to a confusing diagnosis.

As long as there are no signs of weakness or numbness, difficulty walking or talking, double vision, or complete (even if temporary) loss of vision in either eye, this acephalgic migraine can simply be monitored. If they become bothersome, they can definitely be managed with migraine preventive or abortive treatments that your healthcare provider should be able to prescribe.

Does that make sense and does that help address your concerns?

I am pleased to assist you today. If you would be so kind, please help me receive credit for my efforts in answering your questions by pressing the ACCEPT button for this encounter. I will also be glad to answer any other questions until you have the information you need.

### Cloud Tank effect

People have been asking me to provide some of the details of the Cloud Tank so that's been on a long list of subjects. Recently I had to write up some of the notes so thought i'd post it here as well. When I start in visual effects I was hired by Doug Trumbull as his assistant. The first day I was asked to create clouds in a liquid for a film that he had just started working on called Watch the Skies. You may remember it by the final film title, Close Encounters. They needed to create clouds and they liked the look of pouring cream in tea or coffee. I was given a 20 gallon aquarium and $20 of petty cash. I worked it out in a few days with additional ideas from Doug, Wayne Smith and others. This same process was later used in a number of films and commercials. (Raiders of the Lost Ark, James and Giant Peach, ID4, etc) Actually most of these used the same exact tank as well. I've attached a couple of primitive drawings to make it clearer. My photos are packed away deep in boxes otherwise I'd post some here. This was also covered to some extent in the Close Encounters book. [Update: 12-22-11 To make things a little clearer I'm adding some notes here. The basics are a large all glass aquarium was filled halfway with salt water and then fresh water was carefully added to the top. Salt water is heavier so tends to stay on the bottom but you want to avoid mixing them if possible. That's what some of the details below are about. Also best to avoid getting the water too warm. It's very difficult to see any difference in the water once filled since it all looks the same (assuming you've also cleaned the tank and filtered the water). under the right light and angle you may be able to just make out a slight difference. Next white liquid tempra paint is injected in the fresh water portion (top), usually just a few inches from the dividing line of the fresh and salt water. Think of a large syringe with an aquarium tube going into the water. When the tempra paint is injected it billows outward like cumulus clouds and will tend to sink a bit. But the salt water prevents it from going lower so the 'cloud' tends to flatten it's base on the salt water line and and billow outward, similar to real clouds based on air pressure levels. Avoid going below into the saltwater since the clouds will just drop to the bottom of tank. Once you're setup, light the water and create the clouds. You can film while injecting the clouds to get the large billow action or you can film once they're in place. Filming can be under-cranked (less than 24 fps) or over-cranked (over 24 fps) depending on the look desired. Over-cranked will tend to increase the sense of scale and by placing smaller clouds in background you can create force perspective. You'll need to completely drain the tank, clean it and repeat after each shot.] Process in a nutshell as used on Close Encounters: 2000 gallon glass tank approx 7 x 7 x 4 feet deep Water was purified and filtered in 2 large hot tubs/wine tubs(?) 1000-2000 gallons in size. One had rock salt added (probably close to seawater specific gravity but I can't remember the details) The salt water was pumped in first usually to halfway mark, dependent on the shot. Sheet of thin plastic (visqueen) was laid on top. Think of the plastic used for heavy duty trash bags or painter's drop cloths, flexible but not easy to tear. This was longer than the tank front to back and would drape out the back of the tank. A PVC pipe running the width of the tank was placed on top of this with a rig. Later to remove the plastic it would be pulled out and this PVC pipe was used to keep it down. A PVC piping system that looked like a fork from above was placed just above the plastic and the fresh water was pumped in. When done this was removed and the thin plastic sheet was removed. Now it appeared as just a tank of water but there were two layers if you looked very carefully. A large syringe was used with aquarium tubing to add small forced perspective clouds in the distance. The mixed white tempera paint was injected right above the slat water layer. if it went below the tank was contaminated and would require a full redo. Next an atomic arm was used to inject the main clouds during shooting. This allowed the operator to stand in front of the tank near the camera and as they move it around a brass tube was moving in the tank. An electric trigger on the handle would cause the tempera paint to be injected as the arm was moved. The tube came from a pressure cooker filled with the paint. Pressure was supplied from a compressor and an electronic valve was connected to the atomic arm trigger. We also had a light source (with rotating colored lights) that went down this same tube as a fiber optic. Frame rates could be under cranked or over cranked depending on the look.
