Yeah … these two words seem the same but which one should you use?

## Yea vs. yeah

Yea can be used as an informal adverb meaning “yes” or “to affirm,” or as a noun to indicate an affirmative vote. When used in a vote, yea can be pronounced like “yay.”

Yea can also be used as an adverb to amplify an adjective or to say “not only … but also …” (although, this usage of the word appears to be dated, and rarely used in modern English or literature). For example: a good, yea, a delicious cake.

So what about yeah? It is an informal adverb that means “yes.”

## What is the correct spelling?

The correct spelling of the word depends on which way you want to use it. In an informal setting, where it is being used to agree, affirm, or in the place of the word yes, yeah is the more modern, preferred, and commonly used version.

If it is being used in a more formal setting, like a job interview, the formal yes would be the more appropriate choice over yea or yeah.

That may seem a little confusing, but here’s a helpful hint: in most instances it is yeah that you want. It is when you are looking to amplify a descriptive word or vote that yea really comes into play.

OK, here’s a little cheat sheet:

- To affirm, agree, say yes: yea and yeah

- To vote yes: yea and yay (you’re saying this one, not writing it, so it’s really about the pronunciation here!)

- To amplify an adjective, or to say “not only, but also”: yea (for example: This book was a good read, yea, the best I read all year.)

## Why are there two spellings?

Chances are you will find yourself using both yea and yeah in conversation at some point in your life. With both words having similar pronunciations, unless you are casting a vote, nobody will know which version of the word you are using until you write it down.

Voting is when that extra H makes the most difference. For example, it would not be appropriate to vote yeah on a measure, unless you were looking to register your vote with a touch of sarcasm. In other words, you should only vote yea (pronounced similar to the opposing vote of nay) when looking to cast your vote in the positive.

## What is the history of these words?

Sometime around the early 1900s, yea and yes became yeah. While yea (and yes) have been around far longer than the word yeah (it looks like yea and yes can be traced back to the 900s) the sentiment has been around forever.

While the three words once meant the same thing, it appears that the H was added on to distinguish the two meanings above and to move the word forward into the new century. There does not seem to be any clear reason for the addition of the H other than maybe to modernize the spelling of yea. Speakers may have just decided that the word,which is close to 1,300-years-old now, needed a makeover.

All three words are a derivative of Middle English, and have roots in Old Norse and Gothic. While you probably do not hear a lot of the old Middle English (or Old Norse for that matter), both versions of the informal word for yes are still commonly used today.

Home » Yea vs. Yeah: What’s the Difference?

There are often drastic differences between spoken and written language. Spoken language is usually less formal—it incorporates slang, blends, and substitutions in ways that written language doesn’t or sometimes can’t. However, in the long run, the way a language is written often evolves to better suit the way it is spoken.

But it can be difficult to depict these spoken idiosyncrasies in written form. Writers sometimes end up with many similar words, which confuse beginning writers and English language learners.

Yeah and yea are two of these confusing words. They look nearly identical—with only one letter’s difference between them—but they sound and function completely different. Read on to find out whether you should use yea or yeah in your writing.

## What is the Difference Between Yea and Yeah?

In this article, I’ll compare yea vs. yeah. I will go over the definitions of each word and use each word in a sentence to further illustrate its meaning. Plus, I will reveal a useful memory trick to remember which word belongs where.

## When to Use Yea

What does yea mean? Yea is an expression of assent; a yes vote. It rhymes with its opposite, the no vote nay. Yea is rarely used outside of this context. Here are some examples.

- “Shall we go to the pool today, yea or nay?”

- When the speaker called for a voice vote, every representative responded with “yea!”

- The spectacle Brazilians have been waiting for begins on Sunday. That’s when some 513 members of congress will go before a podium and say yea or nay to an impeachment petition. –Forbes

How do you spell yay? Yea has a homophone, yay, which can be a joyous proclamation or a demonstration of size. Homophones sound the same, but differ in meaning. Yay and yea are pronounced the same (they both rhyme with nay) but are used differently. Here are examples of the correct usage of yay.

- “Yay, a puppy!” Krista yelled.

- “The fish was yay big,” Alan lied.

## When to Use Yeah

What does yeah mean? Yeah is a simple affirmative, like yes. It can be used like this:

- “Yeah, I ate the pizza,” Nomar admitted.

- So, yeah, turbochargers. Trouble is, turbos sap energy from the engine’s exhaust-gas stream, which means less sound pressure, less of an aural presence. In a word: volume. –The Wall Street Journal

Yeah came to prominence relatively recently. It is informal, and should be avoided in favor of yes in academic or professional writing.

## Trick to Remember the Difference

If you still don’t think you can keep track of these two words, here is a helpful trick to remember yeah vs. yea.

Yea is primarily used in the context of an affirmative vote. You can remember to save yea for these situations by keeping in mind that neither yea nor the word democracy contain an H.

Yeah does contain an H, and is used as a casual form of the simple affirmative yes.

Yay is an exclamation of happiness or a measure of size.

## Summary

Is it yea or yeah? It can be tempting to use yea when you really mean yeah. There is only one letter’s difference between these two words, and they look like they should sound the same.

Regardless, yeah and yea mean different things. Yea is an affirmative vote. Yeah is casual form of yes. Yay, a homophone of yea, is an exclamation that signals joy or happiness.

You can remember that neither yea or democracy have the letter H, and both are related to voting. This trick should help you remember whether to use yeah or yea in your writing, depending on the context. If you still need a refresher, you can always refer back to this article.

To summarize,

- Yea is a signal of affirmation for a yes vote.

- Yeah is an informal affirmative, similar to yes.

- Yay is an exclamation.

## Yea vs. yeah

*Yea*is pronounced “yay” and it means yes. You would typically use it only under specific circumstances, such as a formal vote. Voting*yea*means that you are in favor of the proposal. Even less commonly in modern speech, it can also be used instead of “indeed” or when you want to emphasize and reiterate something you just said.*Yea*is by no means a recent entry into the language—its origin can be traced all the way back to the Old English word*gēa*.

*Yeah*is usually classified as*yes*’s less formal counterpart. It originated around the beginning of the twentieth century, so there are no Old English words it can be traced to. But words don’t need to have roots that reach a millennium into the past for us to use them.*Yeah*is pronounced*ya*, and sounds like the first part of the word*yam*.

## Yea vs. yeah vs. yay

You pronounce*yay*in the same way you pronounce*yea*, which makes these two words homophones—indistiguishable when spoken and easily confused when written. They have different meanings, though. While*yea*is the word we sometimes use for*yes*,*yay*is the word we use to express joy, approval, or excitement. The origins of*yay*are difficult to pin down—some sources say it came from*yeah*, others say it came from*yea*.

## Examples of yea, yeah, and yay

The lawmaker then presses one of three buttons marked ‘yea,’ ‘nay’ or ‘present,’ and the vote is recorded. The New York Times

Yeah, in that period, the ’60s and ’70s, he would not have been the writer whose work you’d have guessed would have become so significant—someone we’d see as describing the time we’d live in half a century later. Salon

## Yea vs. Yeah – What’s the Gist?

On its face, *yea* and *yeah* seem to reflect the same idea: one of affirmation. Although they look similar, these two words are pronounced differently and have slightly different meanings.

- *Yea* is either an adverb or a noun.
- *Yeah* is an adverb.

Let’s explore the differences.

## How to Use Yea in a Sentence

**Yea****definition:** As an adverb, *yea* (pronounced *yay*) means: during formal voting to indicate yes; or more than this; or informally, to this extent or degree.

For example:

When *yea* functions as a noun, it means affirmation or assent.

For example:

By the way, although *yea* is pronounced just like the word *yay*, the latter is used more to express enthusiasm rather than agreement.

## How to Use Yeah in a Sentence

- The mother asked her family, “Do you want tacos for dinner? Yea or nay?”

**Oh yeah:**This idiom can be either a statement meaning a yes, or a question expressing doubt or surprise, questioning the validity of a statement.

- When the woman said to her friend that she wanted to start running every day, her friend said doubtfully, “Oh yeah?”

**Yeah, baby:**A phrase used when someone gives an enthusiastic response or is happy about something.

- When the boy suggested going out for ice cream, his friend said, “Yeah, baby!”

## How to Remember These Words

The best way to distinguish between these two words is to keep the pronunciations of each one in mind. When you are formally voting on something or informally expressing the size of something, *yea* is pronounced \yay\.

But when you want to express your agreement with something informally, *yeah* is pronounced \yeə\.

For example:

- The councilmember voted, “Yea,” for the change in the statute. (Adverb)
- The grandmother said, “She’s about yea tall.” (Adverb)
- Yeah! Let’s go to the park. (Adverb)

## Quiz: Yea or Yeah

1. The little girl indicated with her hands that the toy was _______ long.
2. He replied informally, “_______,” when asked a question.
3. The student council member voted _______ to add selling snacks during lunch.
4. The little boy grumbled to his dad, “_______, I’m coming.”

## Yea vs. Yeah – What’s the Gist?

On its face, *yea* and *yeah* seem to reflect the same idea: one of affirmation. Although they look similar, these two words are pronounced differently and have slightly different meanings.

- *Yea* is either an adverb or a noun.
- *Yeah* is an adverb.

Let’s explore the differences.

## How to Use Yea in a Sentence

**Yea****definition:** As an adverb, *yea* (pronounced *yay*) means: during formal voting to indicate yes; or more than this; or informally, to this extent or degree.

For example:

- The representative from congress answered, “Yea” when asked if the bill should pass. (Adverb)
- To emphasize the point about no late homework, the teacher said, “Homework will be turned in on time; yea, not even one day will pass, that I will allow it to be turned in.” (Adverb)
- When the little boy was asked how large the fish was that he caught, he demonstrated, “About yea big.” (Adverb)

When *yea* functions as a noun, it means affirmation or assent.

For example:

- After the Senate voted on the bill, the roll call revealed 96 yeas and 0 nays. (Noun)

By the way, although *yea* is pronounced just like the word *yay*, the latter is used more to express enthusiasm rather than agreement.

## How to Use Yeah in a Sentence

**Yeah****definition:**The definition for the adverb *yeah* (pronounced \yeə\) is a simple one; it means yes.

For example:

- When her roommate asked if she was ready for supper, the woman responded, “Yeah.” (Adverb)
- After the grammar professor said that there was no such thing as a double positive, a smart student replied, “Yeah, right.” (Adverb)

Keep in mind that the word *yeah* is an informal expression, and one best used for casual communication.

## Outside Examples of Yea vs. Yeah

- An adaptation of a series of overtly Christian apocalyptic novels which were previously adapted into a film trilogy, this was probably always a tough sell, but critics didn’t hold back, forming the consensus: “Yea verily, like unto a plague of locusts, *Left Behind* hath begat a further scourge of devastation upon Nicolas Cage’s once-proud filmography.” –[Looper](https://www.looper.com/194349/best-worst-nicolas-cage-movies-rotten-tomatoes/)
- Were people voting both yea and nay during voice votes, knowing they were off-screen and wouldn’t get caught? –[Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/26/congress-virtual-remote-work-coronavirus-150362)
- A friend described it as suddenly becoming an administrative assistant to the busiest, and tiniest, CEOs. We schedule their calls, make sure their work stays on track, get them to stop for lunch and even make that lunch. And, oh yeah, my husband and I have jobs, too. –[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2020/03/29/remote-learning-is-turning-out-to-be-a-burden-for-parents/)
- “Both of them without me even trying to sway them one way or another, both of them were like, ‘Yeah, that was by far the best football experience from a fan and a community perspective.’” –[The Plain Dealer](https://www.cleveland.

# Yay, Yea, Yeah, or Yes?

When should you say "yay"?

Two of my friends (Trent Armstrong, the former Modern Manners Guy, and Hyatt Bass, author of the novel The Embers) asked about the word yay and why people so often seem to incorrectly use yea or yeah instead.

## Yay

Yay is an exclamation that shows feelings such as excitement, joy, happiness, triumph, and approval. The origin is fuzzy though. Some dictionaries say it came from yeah, but most seem to think it evolved from the adverbial yay in the phrases yay big and yay high, but then the Oxford English Dictionary says that the yay in yay high probably came from yea. And you wonder why people are confused.

No matter where it came from, the first example sentence for yay in the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1963, and it is fabulous. He talks surfie talk. ‘cowabunga, wipe-out, I’m getting stoked..yay gremmies’. (Gremmies are young or inexperienced surfers who are often annoying. It comes from gremlins. But back to yay.)

## Yea

Yea is a much older word that can be traced all the way back to Old English and that has parallels in all Germanic languages. It’s another way of saying “yes” or “indeed.” It can be an adverb, as in Squiggly loved the chocolate, yea, he reminisced about it for weeks, or it can be a noun, as in Aardvark was one of 30 yeas in favor of limiting access to the lake. Today, people most often use yea when they’re talking about voting.

## Yeah

Finally, yeah is an informal way of saying “yes” that was being used in America by the early 1900s. Yeah is still labeled informal or colloquial in many dictionaries, and some manners guides and articles on professionalism advise readers that yeah is sloppy, and yes is the only mannerly, professional response. (I tend to say “yeah” instead of “yes,” but I’m working on it.)

I heard from people who object to the use of “yea” and “yeah” to mean “yay,” and although I believe such use is often the result of confusion about what each word means, I also like to remember that people shout the word “yes” when they are excited too, so it’s not necessarily inappropriate to use “yea” or “yeah” in such instances.

When choosing a synonym for yes, yeah is probably the first word that comes to mind. However, some people may confuse yea with yeah and use the spellings interchangeably when in fact they are two separate words. Discover when and how to use yea and yeah.

While *yea* and *yeah* look similar and have the same meaning, they do not sound alike and are typically used in different contexts. *Yea* (pronounced yay) comes from the Old English *gēa*. On the other hand, *yeah* (pronounced yah) is by far the more common variation and is an informal version of *yes*.

- yea - an old-fashioned way of saying yes used primarily in voting - yeah - informal version of yes

*Yea* is a formal, old-fashioned version of *yes*and is typically only used in voting or if you are writing a period piece. For example:

- All in favor, say yea. - I vote yea on the proposal. - The author used yea instead of yes because her book was set in the Middle Ages.

While *yea*is formal and rarely used, *yeah*is standard in everyday conversation and writing.

- I asked if he was ready and he said, “Yeah.” - Yeah, I agree. - Oh yeah, I remember that!

*Yea* and *yay* sound alike, making them [homophones](https://www.yourdictionary.com/articles/homonym-homophone-difference), but they have different and unrelated meanings. *Yay* is an exclamation of excitement, triumph or approval. It is also sometimes used to describe a particular or undefined length or degree of something.

- Yay! I caught a fish! - The audience cheered “yay” when the team scored a goal. - The plank of wood is about yay long.

Yea sounds like nay and has the opposite meaning. Nay is a formal, old-fashioned way of saying “no,” and yea is a formal, old-fashioned way of saying “yes.” To remember yeah, recall that it is spelled with an "h."

There are numerous words that have two correct spellings that are meant to be used in different contexts or where one is favored by different writing guides. For example, both blond and blonde are correct, but which should you use and when? Then check out when to use practice and practise.

## saying yes to your friends sounds goofy, because your friends are there to help you escape formalities..so it would almost be insulting in way to be overly polite with them. and on the other hand, saying yeah to your boss basically says you don't give a shit. when you're at work and you have a job you should treat your coworkers as nice and formal as possible so as not to give them a reason for disliking you and making the day more difficult. using yes instead of yeah is a way to express this politeness and demonstrate to your coworkers that you're here to be as helpful as possible.

**Question:**
Is yea an acceptable replacement for yeah?

**Answer:**
'Yea' is a real but antiquated word, still in use in various contexts e.g. 'Whose job is it to say *yea* or *nay*?'Yeah' is the representation of an informal pronunciation of 'yes'. (OED).So if you are reporting informal speech I would suggest you stick with 'yeah'.

“Yea” is a very old-fashioned formal way of saying “yes,” used mainly in voting. It’s the opposite of—and rhymes with—“nay.” When you want to write the common casual version of “yes,” the correct spelling is “yeah” (sounds like “yeh” ). When the third grade teacher announced a class trip to the zoo, we all yelled “yay!” (the opposite of “boo”!). That was back when I was only yay big.
