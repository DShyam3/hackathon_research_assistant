**Timestamp:** 2025-11-22T15:44:12.531055
**Summary:** Giraffes, the tallest mammals on Earth, can reach heights of up to 5 meters (16-18 feet) due to their long legs and necks, with their legs alone being approximately 6 feet tall. They are capable of running at speeds of 35 miles per hour over short distances and can maintain a comfortable cruising speed of 10 miles per hour over longer stretches. Giraffes are primarily found in the dry savannahs of Africa and are characterized by their distinctive spotted patterns, but they are classified as endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts. Their unique physiology and behavior make them one of nature's most fascinating creatures, often admired for their graceful presence in the wild.

**Content:**
Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.

## Behavior

Typically, these fascinating animals roam the open grasslands in small groups of about half a dozen.

Bulls sometimes battle one another by butting their long necks and heads. Such contests aren't usually dangerous and end when one animal submits and walks away.

## Height and Size

Giraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a favorite). Even the giraffe's tongue is long! The 21-inch tongue helps them pluck tasty morsels from branches. Giraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.

The giraffe's height also helps it to keep a sharp lookout for predators across the wide expanse of the African savanna.

The giraffe's stature can be a disadvantage as well—it is difficult and dangerous for a giraffe to drink at a water hole. To do so they must spread their legs and bend down in an awkward position that makes them vulnerable to predators like Africa's big cats. Giraffes only need to drink once every several days; they get most of their water from the luscious plants they eat.

Female giraffes give birth standing up. Their young endure a rather rude welcome into the world by falling more than 5 feet to the ground at birth. These infants can stand in half an hour and run with their mothers an incredible ten hours after birth.

## Population

Giraffes have beautiful spotted coats. While no two individuals have exactly the same pattern, giraffes from the same area appear similar.

Up until recently, the consensus has been there is only one species of giraffe with multiple subspecies. In 2016, some scientists released a study that claims genetic differences among giraffe populations indicate the existence of four distinct giraffe species.

## ABOUT

Hello up there! Why do so many people look up to giraffes—besides the obvious reason? The long and short of it is that they are a wonderful example of nature’s creativity. Giraffes are the tallest land animals. A giraffe could look into a second-story window without even having to stand on its tiptoes! A giraffe's 6-foot (1.8-meter) neck weighs about 600 pounds (272 kilograms). The legs of a giraffe are also 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. The back legs look shorter than the front legs, but they are about the same length. A giraffe's heart is 2 feet (0.6 meters) long and weighs about 25 pounds (11 kilograms), and its lungs can hold 12 gallons (55 liters) of air! Its closest relative is the okapi. Giraffes have a small hump on their back and have a spotted pattern similar to that of a leopard. For a long time people called the giraffe a “camel-leopard,” because they believed that it was a combination of a camel and a leopard. That's where the giraffe's name camelopardalis comes from! Although a study of giraffe genetics published in the scientific journal Current Biology concluded that there are actually four distinct species of giraffes—said to be as different from each other as polar bears are from brown bears—one is currently recognized, with nine subspecies. The subspecies have different coat patterns and live in different parts of Africa. Giraffe coat colors vary from light tan to practically black. The differences occur due to what the giraffes eat and where they live. Each individual giraffe’s markings are as individual as our fingerprints. Masai giraffes, from Kenya, have patterns that look like oak leaves. Uganda or Rothschild's giraffes sport large, brown splotches separated by thick, beige lines. The reticulated giraffe, found only in northern Kenya, has a dark coat with a seeming web of narrow white lines. How many bones are there in a giraffe's neck? Just like humans, giraffes have seven neck vertebrae. For giraffes, however, each one can be over 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) long! Both male and female giraffes have two distinct, hair-covered horns called ossicones. Male giraffes use their horns to spar, throwing their neck against each other. As a male matures, calcium deposits begin to form on his skull to protect it when he head-butts with other males. These calcifications can be quite pronounced, giving the strange appearance of a three- to five-horned giraffe. Giraffes are so big that they really don't need to hide from predators. There is safety in numbers! It’s hard to pick out one giraffe from another when they form a tight group. Besides humans, only lions and crocodiles hunt them. If they have to, giraffes defend themselves with a deadly kick, karate-style. Their speed, the way they move, and their body designs also help them to escape predators if they need to. Giraffes have a way of moving, or gait, in which both the front and back legs on one side move forward together, then the other two legs on the other side move forward. It’s called "pacing." Giraffes can run very fast—around 35 miles (56 kilometers) per hour for short distances. You might think watching out for lions and spending 16 to 20 hours a day eating would all weigh heavily on a giraffe. Surprisingly enough, giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They often achieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time. Giraffes can rest while standing, but they sometimes also lie down with their head resting on their rump. That’s a vulnerable position for a giraffe, though, so usually one herd member stays on guard. Many people think that giraffes have no voice, but they do make a variety of sounds, including moos, roars, snorts, hisses, and grunts. They just very rarely do so. One sound giraffes make when they’re alarmed is a snort. Threats—such as lions nearby—may warrant a snort. Giraffes are often the early warning signal for other savanna wildlife: if a giraffe herd starts to run, everyone else does, too! Studies suggest giraffes vocalize below the level of human hearing and perhaps use this sound for long-distance communication. It’s easy to understand why giraffes top the list of so many people’s favorite wildlife. Their elegant stride, outrageous eyelashes, and calm expression give them an air of refinement.

## HABITAT AND DIET

Blending right in: In a zoo, giraffes stand out. But think of giraffes' presence in their African habitat, where their coat patterns actually serve as camouflage, blending with shadows and leaves. Giraffes are well adapted for living on the open, tree-dotted African plains. While other African herbivores compete for grass and small plants to eat, giraffes have the high branches with tender, young leaves all to themselves. It takes a lot of leaves to fuel such large creatures. Giraffes may eat up to 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of food per day. They spend most of their day eating, because they get just a few leaves in each bite. Their favorite leaves are from acacia trees. These trees have long thorns that keep most wildlife from eating them. But those thorns don't stop the giraffes! They simply use their 18-inch (46-centimeter) tongue and prehensile lips to reach around the thorns. It is thought that the dark color of their tongue protects them from getting sunburned while reaching for leaves. Giraffes also have thick, sticky saliva that coats any thorns they might swallow. Giraffes are ruminants and have a stomach with four compartments that digests the leaves they eat. When giraffes aren't eating, they're chewing their cud. After giraffes swallow the leaves the first time, a ball of leaves travels all the way back up the throat into the mouth for more grinding. Acacia leaves contain a lot of water, so giraffes can go a long time without drinking. When they do get thirsty, giraffes have to bend a long way down to drink from a lake or stream. When they're bent over, it is easier for a predator, like a crocodile, to grab hold of the giraffe. So, giraffes go to a watering hole together and take turns watching for predators. If water is easily available, they can drink 10 gallons (38 liters) a day.

## FAMILY LIFE

When a giraffe baby, called a calf, is born, it comes into the world front feet first, followed by the head, neck, and shoulders. Its entry is like a slow-motion swan dive! Because the umbilical cord is only about 3 feet (1 meter) long, it breaks midway through the birth, allowing the newborn to drop to the ground. The fall and the landing don't hurt the calf, but they do cause it to take a big breath. The calf can stand up and walk after about an hour, and within a week, it starts to sample vegetation. Sometimes the mother leaves the calf alone for most of the day. The youngster sits quietly until she returns. When a calf gets older, the mother leaves her youngster together with other calves in a "nursery." One of the moms stays to babysit while the others go out to eat and socialize. In the nursery, the calves develop physical and social skills through play. Under the watchful eye of the designated babysitter, the youngsters explore their surroundings throughout the day. The young giraffes can eat leaves at the age of four months, but continue to nurse until they are six to nine months old.

## CONSERVATION

In many African countries, giraffe populations are slowly decreasing because of habitat loss and the overgrazing of resources by livestock. As a result, the future of giraffes is dependent on the quality of the habitat that remains. Their numbers have decreased in the past century—one giraffe subspecies, the West African or Nigerian giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis peralta, is vulnerable; and another, the Uganda or Rothschild’s giraffe G.c. rothschildi, is near threatened. While it has historically lived in western Kenya, Uganda, and southern Sudan, the Uganda giraffe has been almost totally eliminated from most of its former range and now survives in only a few small, isolated populations in Kenya and Uganda. The Nigerian giraffe is found in just one area of Niger, and it is considered the rarest of the giraffes. The population of reticulated giraffes G.c. reticulata has dropped by an alarming 80 percent in just 10 years, most likely due to poaching. They are no match for humans with guns; giraffes are shot or snared for their meat, hide, bone marrow, and tail hair. Kenya is starting a giraffe conservation program for the three subspecies found there: reticulated, Uganda, and Masai giraffes G.c. tippelskirchi. San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance supports a community conservation effort in northern Kenya that is finding ways for people and wildlife to live together.

The back legs look shorter than the front legs, but they are about the same length. A giraffe's heart is 2 feet (0.6 meters) long and weighs about 25 pounds (11 kilograms), and its lungs can hold 12 gallons (55 liters) of air! Its closest relative is the okapi. Giraffes have a small hump on their back and have a spotted pattern similar to that of a leopard. For a long time people called the giraffe a “camel-leopard,” because they believed that it was a combination of a camel and a leopard. That's where the giraffe's name camelopardalis comes from! Although a study of giraffe genetics published in the scientific journal Current Biology concluded that there are actually four distinct species of giraffes—said to be as different from each other as polar bears are from brown bears—one is currently recognized, with nine subspecies. The subspecies have different coat patterns and live in different parts of Africa. Giraffe coat colors vary from light tan to practically black. The differences occur due to what the giraffes eat and where they live. Each individual giraffe’s markings are as individual as our fingerprints. Masai giraffes, from Kenya, have patterns that look like oak leaves. Uganda or Rothschild's giraffes sport large, brown splotches separated by thick, beige lines. The reticulated giraffe, found only in northern Kenya, has a dark coat with a seeming web of narrow white lines. How many bones are there in a giraffe's neck? Just like humans, giraffes have seven neck vertebrae. For giraffes, however, each one can be over 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) long! Both male and female giraffes have two distinct, hair-covered horns called ossicones. Male giraffes use their horns to spar, throwing their neck against each other. As a male matures, calcium deposits begin to form on his skull to protect it when he head-butts with other males. These calcifications can be quite pronounced, giving the strange appearance of a three- to five-horned giraffe. Giraffes are so big that they really don't need to hide from predators. There is safety in numbers! It’s hard to pick out one giraffe from another when they form a tight group. Besides humans, only lions and crocodiles hunt them. If they have to, giraffes defend themselves with a deadly kick, karate-style. Their speed, the way they move, and their body designs also help them to escape predators if they need to. Giraffes have a way of moving, or gait, in which both the front and back legs on one side move forward together, then the other two legs on the other side move forward. It’s called "pacing." Giraffes can run very fast—around 35 miles (56 kilometers) per hour for short distances. You might think watching out for lions and spending 16 to 20 hours a day eating would all weigh heavily on a giraffe. Surprisingly enough, giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They often achieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time. Giraffes can rest while standing, but they sometimes also lie down with their head resting on their rump. That’s a vulnerable position for a giraffe, though, so usually one herd member stays on guard. Many people think that giraffes have no voice, but they do make a variety of sounds, including moos, roars, snorts, hisses, and grunts. They just very rarely do so. One sound giraffes make when they’re alarmed is a snort. Threats—such as lions nearby—may warrant a snort. Giraffes are often the early warning signal for other savanna wildlife: if a giraffe herd starts to run, everyone else does, too! Studies suggest giraffes vocalize below the level of human hearing and perhaps use this sound for long-distance communication. It’s easy to understand why giraffes top the list of so many people’s favorite wildlife. Their elegant stride, outrageous eyelashes, and calm expression give them an air of refinement.

## ABOUT

Hello up there! Why do so many people look up to giraffes—besides the obvious reason? The long and short of it is that they are a wonderful example of nature’s creativity. Giraffes are the tallest land animals. A giraffe could look into a second-story window without even having to stand on its tiptoes! A giraffe's 6-foot (1.8-meter) neck weighs about 600 pounds (272 kilograms). The legs of a giraffe are also 6 feet (1.8 meters) long.

## HABITAT AND DIET

Blending right in: In a zoo, giraffes stand out. But think of giraffes' presence in their African habitat, where their coat patterns actually serve as camouflage, blending with shadows and leaves. Giraffes are well adapted for living on the open, tree-dotted African plains. While other African herbivores compete for grass and small plants to eat, giraffes have the high branches with tender, young leaves all to themselves. It takes a lot of leaves to fuel such large creatures. Giraffes may eat up to 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of food per day. They spend most of their day eating, because they get just a few leaves in each bite. Their favorite leaves are from acacia trees. These trees have long thorns that keep most wildlife from eating them. But those thorns don't stop the giraffes! They simply use their 18-inch (46-centimeter) tongue and prehensile lips to reach around the thorns. It is thought that the dark color of their tongue protects them from getting sunburned while reaching for leaves. Giraffes also have thick, sticky saliva that coats any thorns they might swallow. Giraffes are ruminants and have a stomach with four compartments that digests the leaves they eat. When giraffes aren't eating, they're chewing their cud. After giraffes swallow the leaves the first time, a ball of leaves travels all the way back up the throat into the mouth for more grinding. Acacia leaves contain a lot of water, so giraffes can go a long time without drinking. When they do get thirsty, giraffes have to bend a long way down to drink from a lake or stream. When they're bent over, it is easier for a predator, like a crocodile, to grab hold of the giraffe. So, giraffes go to a watering hole together and take turns watching for predators. If water is easily available, they can drink 10 gallons (38 liters) a day.

## HABITAT AND DIET

## FAMILY LIFE

When a giraffe baby, called a calf, is born, it comes into the world front feet first, followed by the head, neck, and shoulders. Its entry is like a slow-motion swan dive! Because the umbilical cord is only about 3 feet (1 meter) long, it breaks midway through the birth, allowing the newborn to drop to the ground. The fall and the landing don't hurt the calf, but they do cause it to take a big breath. The calf can stand up and walk after about an hour, and within a week, it starts to sample vegetation. Sometimes the mother leaves the calf alone for most of the day. The youngster sits quietly until she returns. When a calf gets older, the mother leaves her youngster together with other calves in a "nursery." One of the moms stays to babysit while the others go out to eat and socialize. In the nursery, the calves develop physical and social skills through play. Under the watchful eye of the designated babysitter, the youngsters explore their surroundings throughout the day. The young giraffes can eat leaves at the age of four months, but continue to nurse until they are six to nine months old.

## CONSERVATION

In many African countries, giraffe populations are slowly decreasing because of habitat loss and the overgrazing of resources by livestock. As a result, the future of giraffes is dependent on the quality of the habitat that remains. Their numbers have decreased in the past century—one giraffe subspecies, the West African or Nigerian giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis peralta, is vulnerable; and another, the Uganda or Rothschild’s giraffe G.c. rothschildi, is near threatened. While it has historically lived in western Kenya, Uganda, and southern Sudan, the Uganda giraffe has been almost totally eliminated from most of its former range and now survives in only a few small, isolated populations in Kenya and Uganda. The Nigerian giraffe is found in just one area of Niger, and it is considered the rarest of the giraffes. The population of reticulated giraffes G.c. reticulata has dropped by an alarming 80 percent in just 10 years, most likely due to poaching. They are no match for humans with guns; giraffes are shot or snared for their meat, hide, bone marrow, and tail hair. Kenya is starting a giraffe conservation program for the three subspecies found there: reticulated, Uganda, and Masai giraffes G.c. tippelskirchi. San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance supports a community conservation effort in northern Kenya that is finding ways for people and wildlife to live together.

At an average height of around 5 m (16-18 ft.), the giraffe is the tallest land animal in the world.

Giraffes average around 5 m (16-18 ft.) tall! Photo by Byrdyak / iStock.com.

Characterized by its long legs, long neck, and distinctive spotted pattern, many people first believed the giraffe was a cross between a leopard and a camel, which is reflected in its scientific name, Giraffa camelopardalis.

Giraffes live primarily in savanna areas in the sub-Saharan region of Africa.

## Benefits of Height

Giraffes’ extreme height provides several advantages. It allows them to eat leaves and shoots located much higher than other animals can reach.

Their height also gives them a great vantage point to spot predators, like lions, leopards, and hyenas. Some scientists believe other prey animals stay close to giraffes because giraffes can warn them of danger.

## Long Necks

You may think that because giraffe necks are so long, they must have lots of bones in their necks. But giraffes actually have the same number of bones in their necks (vertebrae) as we do, which is seven.

Giraffe neck vertebrae are very long, however. Each vertebra could be as long as 25 cm (10 in.)!

Their necks may be long, but giraffes still have the same number of neck bones as we do! Photo by PeterVanDam / iStock.com.

Giraffe neck vertebrae also differ from ours in that their neck joints are more like our shoulder joints. This allows for a greater range of motion and makes their necks really flexible.

Giraffes have a special ligament that runs through their neck and back. This ligament helps hold up their neck and head so they don’t have to rely on just their muscles for support.

In order to pump blood 1.8 m (6 ft.) up their necks into their heads, giraffes need a super strong heart. The walls in the left ventricle of their heart are very thick allowing for increased pumping power.

## Giraffe Horns?

Giraffe horns are not actually horns. And they’re not antlers either. Both male and female giraffes have skin-covered bony bumps on their heads, which are called ossicones.

Female ossicones are smaller and have a small tuft of fur on top, while male ossicones are often bald on the top.

Male giraffes lose hair on their ossicones because they use them to fight. They swing their heads and necks at each other in a show of strength called “necking.”

## Long Blue Tongues

Giraffes use their long, prehensile tongues to pull leaves from the trees to eat. Their tongues can be up to 50 cm (20 in.) long!

The front part of a giraffe’s tongue is blue, purple, or black, while the back part is pink. It is thought that this darker coloration in the front protects their tongues from sun damage while the giraffe is eating.

## What Giraffes Eat

Giraffes eat leaves and shoots of trees and shrubs. In particular, they seek out acacia and mimosa trees.

Spending most of the day eating, a full-grown giraffe consumes over 45 kg (100 lb.) of vegetation a day.

Similar to cows, giraffes have four compartments in their stomachs to help break down the fibrous plant material they eat. In addition, food from their stomach (known as cud) passes back up their neck into their mouth so they can chew it some more.

## Giraffe Movement

When giraffes walk, they move both legs on one side of their body and then both legs on the other side, which is unusual.

However, they run in a similar style to other mammals, swinging their rear legs and front legs in unison.

They can reach 55 km/h (35 mph) at full speed but only in brief spurts.

## How Giraffes Sleep

Did you know giraffes sleep less than two hours a day?

In general, giraffes sleep with their feet tucked under them and their head resting on their hindquarters, but they can also sleep for short periods of time standing up.

## Giraffe Social Life

Typically, giraffes live in groups of about 10-20, though herds can be as large as 60.

Recent studies have shown that giraffes can have very strong pair bonds, especially between mothers and their young.

## How Giraffes Communicate

Giraffes communicate with each other with snorts, sneezes and coughs. One study in 2015 showed that giraffes also make low-pitched humming sounds at night.

Take a listen here:

## Giraffe Reproduction

Female giraffes can become pregnant at 5 years old. They carry a baby for 15 months and give birth while standing up. That means baby giraffes fall about 2 m (6 ft.) to the ground when they’re born!

Newborns are about 2 m (6 ft.) tall and weigh 70 kg (150 lb.).

Giraffes live up to 25 years in the wild.

## Conservation Status

Giraffes are classified by IUCN’s Red List as vulnerable of extinction. After researchers surveyed the population in trucks, by foot, by aircraft, and by remote cameras, they confirmed the number of giraffes has plummeted 40% since 1985.

With some subspecies, such as the reticulated giraffe, the situation is even more dire, with their population declining by nearly 80%.

Giraffes face several threats, including loss of habitat due to logging for firewood. They are also hunted for their meat, hides, and tails, which are valued by many African tribes.

## What You Can Do to Help

To help preserve giraffe populations, boycott products made with giraffe body parts and encourage others to do the same.

| Distribution of the giraffe |

The **giraffe** is a large [African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna_of_Africa) [hoofed mammal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even-toed_ungulate) belonging to the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) *Giraffa.* It is the [tallest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_mammals#Even-toed_Ungulates_(Artiodactyla)) living [terrestrial animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_animal) and the largest [ruminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant) on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). It is classified under the [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)) [Giraffidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffidae), along with its closest extant relative, the [okapi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi). Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species), *Giraffa camelopardalis*, with nine [subspecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies). Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four [extant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neontology#Extant_taxa_versus_extinct_taxa) species, with seven subspecies, which can be distinguished morphologically by their fur [coat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_coat) patterns. Six valid [extinct species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_extinct_species) of *Giraffa* are known from the [fossil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil) record.

The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like [ossicones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicone), and spotted coat patterns. Its scattered range extends from [Chad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad) in the north to [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa) in the south and from [Niger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger) in the west to [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia) in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit [savannahs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah) and [woodlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland). Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily [acacia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacieae) species, which they browse at heights most other ground-based [herbivores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore) cannot reach. [Lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion), [leopards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard), [spotted hyenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_hyena), and [African wild dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_dog) may [prey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey) upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males but are [gregarious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregarious) and may gather in large groups. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. [Dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)) males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for rearing the young.

The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the [International Union for Conservation of Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature) (IUCN) as [vulnerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species) to extinction. It has been [extirpated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction) from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in many [national parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park) and [game reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_reserve), but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of *Giraffa* in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.

## Etymology

The name "giraffe" has its earliest known origins in the [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language) word zirāfah (زِرَافَةْ), of an ultimately unclear [Sub-Saharan African language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Africa) origin.[2] The [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English) and [early Modern English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_English) spellings, jarraf and ziraph, derive from the Arabic form-based [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language) and [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language) *girafa*.[3] The modern English form developed around 1600 from the [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) girafe.[2]

"Camelopard" ([archaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaism) English name for the giraffe; it derives from the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) καμηλοπάρδαλις (kamēlopárdalis), from κάμηλος (kámēlos), "[camel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel)", and πάρδαλις (párdalis), "[leopard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard)", referring to its camel-like shape and leopard-like colouration.[4][5]

## Taxonomy

### Evolution

The giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order [Artiodactyla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artiodactyla), the other being the [okapi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi).[6] They are [ruminants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant) of the clade [Pecora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecora), along with [Antilocapridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antilocapridae) ([pronghorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronghorn)), [Cervidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervidae) (deer), [Bovidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovidae) (cattle, antelope, goats and sheep) and [Moschidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moschidae) (musk deer). A 2019 [genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) study (cladogram below) finds that Giraffidae are a [sister taxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_taxon) to Antilocapridae, with an estimated [split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_(phylogenetics)) of over 20 million years ago.[7]

The family Giraffidae was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil [genera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) described.[6] The elongation of the neck appears to have started early in the giraffe [lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_(evolution)). Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down.[8] One early giraffid ancestor was *Canthumeryx*, which has been dated variously to have lived 25 to 20 million years ago, 17–15 mya or 18–14.3 mya and whose deposits have been found in Libya. This animal resembled an [antelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antelope) and had a medium-sized, lightly built body. *Giraffokeryx* appeared 15–12 mya on the [Indian subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent) and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe, and had a longer neck and similar [ossicones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicone).[6] *Giraffokeryx* may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like *Sivatherium* and *Bramatherium*.[8]

The extinct giraffid *Samotherium* (middle) in comparison with the [okapi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi) (below) and giraffe. The anatomy of *Samotherium* appears to have shown a transition to a giraffe-like neck.[9]

Giraffids like *Palaeotragus*, *Shansitherium* and *Samotherium* appeared 14 mya and lived throughout Africa and Eurasia. These animals had broader skulls with reduced frontal cavities.[6][8] *Paleotragus* resembled the okapi and may have been its ancestor.[6] Others find that the okapi lineage diverged earlier, before *Giraffokeryx*.[8] *Samotherium* was a particularly important [transitional fossil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_fossil) in the giraffe lineage, as the length and structure of its [cervical vertebrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae) were between those of a modern giraffe and an okapi, and its neck posture was likely similar to the former's.[9] *Bohlinia*, which first appeared in southeastern Europe and lived 9–7 mya, was likely a direct ancestor of the giraffe. *Bohlinia* closely resembled modern giraffes, having a long neck and legs and similar ossicones and dentition.[6]

*Bohlinia* colonised China and northern India and produced the *Giraffa*, which, around 7 million years ago, reached Africa. [Climate changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) led to the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1 million years ago in eastern Africa during the [Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene).[6] Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from *G. jumae*;[10] others find *G. gracilis* a more likely candidate. *G. jumae* was larger and more robust, while *G. gracilis* was smaller and more slender.[6]

The changes from extensive forests to more open [habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat), which began 8 mya, are believed to be the main driver for the evolution of giraffes.[6] During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid [C4 plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_plant), and a dry [savannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah) emerged across eastern and northern Africa and western India.[11][12] Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat, coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution.[13] The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.[6]

The giraffe genome is around 2.9 billion [base pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair) in length, compared to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the okapi. Of the proteins in giraffe and okapi genes, 19.4% are identical. The [divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_evolution) of giraffe and okapi lineages dates to around 11.5 mya. A small group of [regulatory genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_gene) in the giraffe appears responsible for the animal's height and associated circulatory adaptations.[14][15]

Coloured dots on the map represent sampling localities. The phylogenetic tree is a [maximum-likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_phylogenetic_tree) [phylogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree#Special_tree_types) based on samples from 266 giraffes. Asterisks along branches correspond to [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade#Definitions) values of more than 90% [bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)) support. Stars at branch tips identify [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyletic) [haplotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype) found in Maasai and reticulated giraffes".[16]

[Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus) originally classified living giraffes as one species in 1758. He gave it the [binomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature) name *Cervus camelopardalis*. [Mathurin Jacques Brisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathurin_Jacques_Brisson) coined the generic name *Giraffa* in 1762.[17] During the 1900s, various taxonomies with two or three species were proposed.[18] A 2007 study on the genetics of giraffes using mitochondrial DNA suggested at least six lineages could be recognised as species.[16] A 2011 study using detailed analyses of the morphology of giraffes, and application of the [phylogenetic species concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species), described eight species of living giraffes.[19] A 2016 study also concluded that living giraffes consist of multiple species. The researchers suggested the existence of four species, which have not exchanged genetic information between each other for one to two million years.[20]

A 2020 study showed that, depending on the method chosen, different taxonomic hypotheses recognizing from two to six species can be considered for the genus *Giraffa*. That study also found that multi-species coalescent methods can lead to taxonomic over-splitting, as those methods delimit geographic structures rather than species. The three-species hypothesis, which recognises *G. camelopardalis*, *G. giraffa*, and *G. tippelskirchi*, is highly supported by [phylogenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics) analyses and also corroborated by most population genetic and multi-species coalescent analyses.[21] A 2021 [whole genome sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing) study suggests the existence of four distinct species and seven subspecies,[22] which was supported by a 2024 study of cranial morphology.[23] A 2024 study found a higher amount of ancient [gene flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_flow) than expected between populations.[24]

The [cladogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladogram) below shows the phylogenetic relationship between the four species and seven subspecies based on a 2021 genome analysis.[22] The eight lineages correspond to eight traditional subspecies in the one-species hypothesis. The Rothschild giraffe is subsumed into *G. camelopardalis camelopardalis*.

The following table compares the different hypotheses for giraffe species. The description column shows the traditional nine subspecies in the one-species hypothesis.[1][25]

| Description | Image | Eight species taxonomy[19] | Four species taxonomy[20][22] | Three species taxonomy[21] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum) has a distribution which includes southern Chad, the Central African Republic, northern Cameroon, and the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.[1] Populations in Cameroon were formerly included in G. c. peralta, but this was incorrect.[26] Compared to the Nubian giraffe, this subspecies has smaller and more irregular spotting patterns. Its spots are present on insides of the legs, sometimes below the hocks. A median lump is present in males.[27]: 51–52 Some 2,000 are believed to remain in the wild.[1] Considerable confusion has existed over the status of this subspecies and G. c. peralta in zoos. In 2007, all alleged G. c. peralta in European zoos were shown to be, in fact, G. c. antiquorum.[26] With this correction, about 65 are living in zoos.[28] | | Kordofan giraffe (G. antiquorum)[29] | Northern giraffe (G. camelopardalis) Three or four subspecies: G. c. antiquorum G. c. camelopardalis G. c. peralta G. c. reticulata (only in three-species hypothesis) |
| The Nubian giraffe (G. c. camelopardalis), is found in eastern South Sudan and southwestern Ethiopia, in addition to Kenya and Uganda.[1] It has sharp-edged chestnut-coloured spots surrounded by mostly white lines, while undersides lack spotting. A lump is prominent in the middle of the male's head.[27]: 51 Around 2,150 are thought to remain in the wild, with another 1,500 individuals belonging to the Rothschild's ecotype.[1] With the addition of Rothschild's giraffe to the Nubian subspecies, the Nubian giraffe is very common in captivity, although the original phenotype is rare — a group is kept at Al Ain Zoo in the United Arab Emirates.[30] In 2003, this group numbered 14.[31] | | Nubian giraffe (G. camelopardalis)[25] Also known as Baringo giraffe or Ugandan giraffe Two subspecies: G. c. camelopardalis G. c. rothschildi (Rothschild's giraffe) |
| Rothschild's giraffe (G. c. rothschildi) may be an ecotype of G. camelopardalis. Its range includes parts of Uganda and Kenya.[1] Its presence in South Sudan is uncertain.[32] This giraffe has large dark patches with normally well-defined edges but sometimes split. The dark spots may also have swirls of pale colour within them. Spotting rarely reaches below the hocks and rarely to the hooves. This ecotype may also develop five "horns".[27]: 53 Around 1,500 individuals are believed to remain in the wild,[1] and more than 450 are living in zoos.[28] According to genetic analysis circa September 2016, it is conspecific with the Nubian giraffe (G. c. camelopardalis).[20] | |
| The West African giraffe (G. c. peralta) is endemic to southwestern Niger.[1] This animal has a lighter pelage (fur) than other subspecies,[33]: 322 with red lobe-shaped blotches that reach under the hocks. The ossicones are more erect than in other subspecies, and males have well-developed median lumps.[27]: 52–53 It is the most endangered subspecies within Giraffa, with 400 individuals remaining in the wild.[1] Giraffes in Cameroon were formerly believed to belong to this species, but are actually G. c. antiquorum. This error resulted in some confusion over its status in zoos, but in 2007 it was established that all "G. c. peralta" kept in European zoos are actually G. c. antiquorum. The same 2007 study found that the West African giraffe was more closely related to Rothschild's giraffe than the Kordofan, and its ancestor may have migrated from eastern to northern Africa and then west as the Sahara Desert spread. At its largest, Lake Chad may have acted as a boundary between the West African and Kordofan giraffes during the Holocene (before 5000 BC).[26] | | West African giraffe (G. peralta),[34] Also known as Niger giraffe or Nigerian giraffe |
| The reticulated giraffe (G. c. reticulata) is native to northeastern Kenya, southern Ethiopia, and Somalia.[1] Its distinctive coat pattern consists of sharp-edged, reddish-brown polygonal patches surrounded by thin white lines. Spots may or may not extend under the hocks, and a median lump is present in males.[27]: 53 An estimated 8,660 individuals remain in the wild,[1] and based on International Species Information System records, more than 450 are living in zoos.[28] A 2024 study found that the reticulated giraffe is the result of hybridisation between northern and southern giraffe lineages.[24] | | Reticulated giraffe (G. reticulata),[35] Also known as Somali giraffe | |
| The Angolan giraffe (G. c. angolensis)[36] occurs in northern Namibia, southwestern Zambia, central Botswana, western Zimbabwe, southern Zimbabwe and, since mid-2023, again in Angola.[37][1][38][39] A 2009 genetic study on this subspecies suggested the northern Namib Desert and Etosha National Park populations form a separate subspecies.[40] This subspecies is white with large brown blotches with pointed or cut edges. The spotting pattern extends throughout the legs but not the upper part of the face. The neck and rump patches tend to be fairly small. The subspecies also has a white ear mark.[27]: 51 About 13,000 animals are estimated to remain in the wild,[1] and about 20 are living in zoos.[28] | | Angolan giraffe (G. angolensis) Also known as Namibian giraffe | Southern giraffe (G. giraffa) Two subspecies: G. g. angolensis G. g. giraffa |
| The South African giraffe (G. c. giraffa) is found in northern South Africa, southern Botswana, northern Botswana and southwestern Mozambique.[1][38][39] It has a tawny background colour marked with dark, somewhat rounded patches "with some fine projections". The spots extend down the legs, growing smaller as they do. The median lump of males is relatively small.[27]: 52 A maximum of 31,500 are estimated to remain in the wild,[1] and around 45 are living in zoos.[28] | | South African giraffe (G. giraffa)[41] Also known as Cape giraffe |
| The Masai giraffe (G. c. tippelskirchi) can be found in central and southern Kenya and in Tanzania.[1] Its coat patterns are highly diverse, with spots ranging from mostly rounded and smooth-edged to oval-shaped and incised or loped-edged.[42] A median lump is usually present in males.[27]: 54 [43] A total of 32,550 are thought to remain in the wild,[1] and about 100 are living in zoos.[28] | | Masai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi)[36] Also known as Kilimanjaro giraffe | Masai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi) Two subspecies: G. t. tippelskirchi G. t. thornicrofti |
| Thornicroft's giraffe (G. c. thornicrofti) is restricted to the Luangwa Valley in eastern Zambia.[1] It has notched and somewhat star-shaped patches which and may or may not extend across the legs. The median lump of males is modestly sized.[27]: 54 No more than 550 remain in the wild,[1] with none in zoos.[28] It was named after Harry Scott Thornicroft.[36] | | Thornicroft's giraffe ("G. thornicrofti") Also known as Luangwa giraffe or Rhodesian giraffe |

The first extinct species to be described was *Giraffa sivalensis* from Pakistan, the holotype of which was reevaluated as a vertebra of separate species within the genus that was initially described as a fossil of the living giraffe.[44] Another extinct species *Giraffa punjabiensis* is known from Pakistan.[45] Four other valid extinct species of *Giraffa* known from Africa are *Giraffa gracilis*, *Giraffa jumae*, *Giraffa pygmaea* and *Giraffa stillei*.[8] "*G.*" *pomeli* from Algeria and Tunisia is not a species of Giraffinae, but a species of Palaeotraginae related to *Mitilanotherium*.[46]

## Anatomy

Giraffe skeleton on display at the [Museum of Osteology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Osteology), [Oklahoma City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City)

Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3–5.7 m (14–19 ft) tall, with [males taller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism) than females.[47] The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female.[48] Despite its long neck and legs, its body is relatively short.[49]: 66 The skin is mostly gray[48] or tan,[50] and can reach a thickness of 20 mm (0.79 in).[51]: 87 The 80–100 cm (31–39 in) long[36] tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.[51]: 94

The [coat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_coat) has dark blotches or patches, which can be orange, [chestnut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut_(color)), brown, or nearly black, surrounded by light hair, usually white or [cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(colour)) coloured.[52] Male giraffes become darker as they grow old.[43] The coat pattern [has been claimed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_coloration#A_disputed_case:_the_giraffe) to serve as [camouflage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage) in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands.[36] When standing among trees and bushes, they are hard to see at even a few metres distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on camouflage, which may be more important for calves.[6] Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern.[53][54] Calves inherit some coat pattern traits from their mothers, and variation in some spot traits is correlated with calf survival.[42] The skin under the blotches may regulate the animal's body temperature, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large [sweat glands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_gland).[55] Spotless or solid-colour giraffes are very rare, but have been observed.[56][57]

The fur may give the animal chemical defense, as its parasite repellents give it a characteristic scent. At least 11 main [aromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity) chemicals are in the fur, although [indole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indole) and [3-methylindole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-methylindole) are responsible for most of the smell. Because males have a stronger odour than females, it may also have a [sexual function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexual_behaviour).[58]

### Head

Closeup of the head of a Southern giraffe

Both sexes have prominent horn-like structures called [ossicones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicone), which can reach 13.5 cm (5.3 in). They are formed from [ossified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification) [cartilage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage), covered in skin, and fused to the [skull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull) at the [parietal bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_bone).[43][51]: 95–97 Being [vascularised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel), the ossicones may have a role in [thermoregulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation),[55] and are used in combat between males.[59] Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males tend to be bald and knobbed on top.[43] A lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges in the middle of the skull.[17] Males develop [calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium) deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age.[52] Multiple [sinuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_(anatomy)) lighten a giraffe's skull.[51]: 103 However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat.[43] The [occipital condyles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_condyles) at the bottom of the skull allow the animal to tip its head over 90 degrees and grab food on the branches directly above them with the tongue.[51]: 103, 110[17]

With eyes located on the sides of the head, the giraffe has a broad [visual field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view) from its great height.[51]: 85, 102 Compared to other [ungulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungulate), giraffe vision is more [binocular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision) and the eyes are larger with a greater [retinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina) surface area.[60] Giraffes may see in colour,[51]: 85 and their senses of hearing and [smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction) are sharp.[52] The ears are movable.[51]: 95 The nostrils are slit-shaped, possibly to withstand blowing sand.[61] The giraffe's [tongue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue) is about 45 cm (18 in) long. It is black, perhaps to protect against sunburn, and can [grasp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehensile) foliage and delicately pick off leaves.[51]: 109–110 The upper lip is flexible and hairy to protect against sharp prickles.[17] The upper jaw has a hard [palate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate) instead of front teeth. The [molars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)) and [premolars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar) are wide with low [crowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(tooth)) on the surface.[51]: 106

### Neck

The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) in length.[62] Along the neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs.[17] The neck typically rests at an angle of 50–60 degrees, though juveniles are closer to 70 degrees.[51]: 72–73 The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the [cervical vertebrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae), not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over 28 cm (11 in) long.[49]: 71 They comprise 52–54 per cent of the length of the giraffe's [vertebral column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column), compared with the 27–33 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe's closest living relative, the [okapi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi).[13] This elongation largely takes place after birth, perhaps because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time [giving birth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giving_birth) to young with the same neck proportions as adults.[63] The giraffe's head and neck are held up by large muscles and a [nuchal ligament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuchal_ligament), which are anchored by long [thoracic vertebrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_vertebrae) spines, giving them a hump.[17][64][36]

Adult male [reticulated giraffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_giraffe) feeding high on an acacia, in Kenya

The giraffe's neck vertebrae have [ball and socket joints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_and_socket_joint).[49]: 71 The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie between the first and second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike in most other ruminants, where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1.[13][63] This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra.[64] However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other [morphological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)) features, such as an articulating [rib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib), deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased [neurological anomalies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder) and maladies.[13]

There are several hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origin and maintenance of elongation in giraffe necks.[59] [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) originally suggested the "competing [browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browsing_(predation)) hypothesis", which has been challenged only recently. It suggests that competitive pressure from smaller browsers, like [kudu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudu), [steenbok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steenbok) and [impala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impala), encouraged the elongation of the neck, as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not. This advantage is real, as giraffes can and do feed up to 4.5 m (15 ft) high, while even quite large competitors, such as kudu, can feed up to only about 2 m (6 ft 7 in) high.[65] There is also research suggesting that browsing competition is intense at lower levels, and giraffes feed more efficiently (gaining more leaf biomass with each mouthful) high in the canopy.[66][67] However, scientists disagree about just how much time giraffes spend feeding at levels beyond the reach of other browsers,[10][59][65][68] and a 2010 study found that adult giraffes with longer necks actually suffered higher mortality rates under drought conditions than their shorter-necked counterparts. This study suggests that maintaining a longer neck requires more nutrients, which puts longer-necked giraffes at risk during a food shortage.[69]

Another theory, the [sexual selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection) hypothesis, proposes that long necks evolved as a secondary [sexual characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism), giving males an advantage in "necking" contests to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive females.[10] In support of this theory, some studies have stated that necks are longer and heavier for males than females of the same age,[10][59] and that males do not employ other forms of combat.[10] However, a 2024 study found that, while males have thicker necks, females actually have proportionally longer ones, which is likely because of their greater need to find more food to sustain themselves and their dependent young.[70] It has also been proposed that the neck serves to give the animal greater vigilance.[71][72]

### Legs, locomotion and posture

The front legs tend to be longer than the hind legs,[51]: 109 and males have proportionally longer front legs than females, which gives them better support when swinging their necks during fights.[70] The leg bones lack first, second and fifth [metapodials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metapodial).[51]: 109 It appears that a [suspensory ligament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspensory_ligament) allows the lanky legs to support the animal's great weight.[73] The [hooves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoof) of large male giraffes reach 31 cm × 23 cm (12.2 in × 9.1 in) in diameter.[51]: 98 The [fetlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetlock) of the leg is low to the ground, allowing the hoof to better support the animal's weight. Giraffes lack [dewclaws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewclaw) and interdigital glands. While the pelvis is relatively short, the [ilium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilium_(bone)) has stretched-out crests.[17]

A giraffe has only two [gaits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait): walking and galloping. Walking is done by moving the legs on one side of the body, then doing the same on the other side.[43] When galloping, the hind legs move around the front legs before the latter move forward,[52] and the tail will curl up.[43] The movements of the head and neck provide balance and control momentum while galloping.[33]: 327–29 The giraffe can reach a sprint speed of up to 60 km/h (37 mph),[74] and can sustain 50 km/h (31 mph) for several kilometres.[75] Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water,[76] although they might be able to float.[77] When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony[76][77] or keep its head above the water's surface.[76]

A juvenile giraffe walking in Malawi

A giraffe rests by lying with its body on top of its folded legs.[33]: 329 To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers the rest of its body. To get back up, it first gets on its front knees and positions its backside on top of its hindlegs. It then pulls the backside upwards, and the front legs stand straight up again. At each stage, the animal swings its head for balance.[51]: 67 If the giraffe wants to reach down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees.[43] Studies in captivity found the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night. It usually sleeps lying down; however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short "deep sleep" phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate [paradoxical sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxical_sleep).[78]

### Internal systems

Scheme of path of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in giraffe

In mammals, the left [recurrent laryngeal nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_laryngeal_nerve) is longer than the right; in the giraffe, it is over 30 cm (12 in) longer. These nerves are longer in the giraffe than in any other living animal;[79] the left nerve is over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) long.[80] Each nerve cell in this path begins in the [brainstem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem) and passes down the neck along the [vagus nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve), then branches off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve which passes back up the neck to the larynx. Thus, these nerve cells have a length of nearly 5 m (16 ft) in the largest giraffes.[79] Despite its long neck and large skull, the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) of the giraffe is typical for an ungulate.[81] Evaporative heat loss in the nasal passages keep the giraffe's brain cool.[55] The shape of the skeleton gives the giraffe a small [lung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung) volume relative to its mass. Its long neck gives it a large amount of [dead space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_space_(physiology)), though this is limited by its narrow windpipe. The giraffe also has a high [tidal volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_volume), so the balance of dead space and tidal volume is much the same as other mammals. The animal can still provide enough oxygen for its tissues, and it can increase its [respiratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing) rate and oxygen diffusion when running.[82]

[Reticulated giraffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_giraffe) bending down to drink in Kenya. The circulatory system is adapted to deal with blood flow rushing down its neck.

The giraffe's [circulatory system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system) has several adaptations to compensate for its great height.[14] Its 11 kg (25 lb) and 60 cm (2 ft) [heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart) must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as 7.5 cm (3.0 in).[52] Giraffes have relatively high heart rates for their size, at 150 beats per minute.[49]: 76 When the animal lowers its head, the blood rushes down fairly unopposed and a [rete mirabile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_mirabile) in the upper neck, with its large [cross-sectional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(geometry)) area, prevents excess blood flow to the brain. When it raises again, the blood vessels constrict and push blood into the brain so the animal does not faint.[83] The [jugular veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugular_vein) contain several (most commonly seven) valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the [inferior vena cava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava) and [right atrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_atrium) while the head is lowered.[84] Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them. To solve this problem, the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight, preventing too much blood from pouring into them.[36]

Giraffes have [oesophageal muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus) that are strong enough to allow regurgitation of food from the stomach up the neck and into the mouth for [rumination](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ruminate).[49]: 78 They have [four-chambered stomachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant#Digestive_system_of_ruminants), which are adapted to their specialized diet.[17] The [intestines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestine) of an adult giraffe measure more than 70 m (230 ft) in length and have a relatively small ratio of [small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine) to [large intestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine).[85] The giraffe has a small, compact liver.[49]: 76 In fetuses there may be a small [gallbladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder) that vanishes before birth.[17][86][87]

## Behaviour and ecology

### Habitat and feeding

A Masai giraffe extending its tongue to feed, in Tanzania.A giraffe in Malawi eating leaves from a tree

Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open [woodlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland). They prefer areas dominated by [Acacieae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacieae), *Commiphora*, *Combretum* and *Terminalia* trees over *Brachystegia* which are more densely spaced.[33]: 322 The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments.[88] Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring those of the subfamily Acacieae and the genera *Commiphora* and *Terminalia*,[89] which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth rate.[6] They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit.[33]: 324 A giraffe eats around 34 kg (75 lb) of plant matter daily.[43] When stressed, giraffes may chew on large branches, stripping them of bark.[33]: 325 Giraffes are also recorded to [chew old bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteophagy).[51]: 102

During the wet season, food is abundant and giraffes are more spread out, while during the dry season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes.[89] Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably to make it easier to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency.[68] As a [ruminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant), the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again.[49]: 78–79 The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system.[89] The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets.[17] When it has access to water, a giraffe will go no more than three days without drinking.[43]

Giraffes have a great effect on the trees that they feed on, delaying the growth of young trees for some years and giving "waistlines" to particularly tall trees. Feeding is at its highest during the first and last hours of daytime. Between these hours, giraffes mostly stand and ruminate. Rumination is the dominant activity during the night, when it is mostly done lying down.[43]

### Social life

Gathering of female South African giraffes in [Tswalu Kalahari Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tswalu_Kalahari_Reserve), South Africa. These animals commonly gather in herds.

Giraffes usually form groups that vary in size and composition according to ecological, anthropogenic, temporal, and social factors.[90] Traditionally, the composition of these groups had been described as open and ever-changing.[91] For research purposes, a "group" has been defined as "a collection of individuals that are less than a kilometre apart and moving in the same general direction".[92] More recent studies have found that giraffes have long-lasting social groups or cliques based on kinship, sex or other factors, and these groups regularly associate with other groups in larger communities or sub-communities within a [fission–fusion society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission%E2%80%93fusion_society).[93][94][95][96] Proximity to humans can disrupt social arrangements.[93] Masai giraffes in Tanzania sort themselves into different subpopulations of 60–90 adult females with overlapping ranges, each of which differ in reproductive rates and calf mortality.[97] [Dispersal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_dispersal) is male biased, and can include spatial and/or social dispersal.[98] Adult female subpopulations are connected by males into super communities of around 300 animals.[99]

The number of giraffes in a group can range from one up to 66 individuals.[90][96] Giraffe groups tend to be sex-segregated[96] although mixed-sex groups made of adult females and young males also occur.[92] Female groups may be [matrilineally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineally) related.[96] Generally, females are more selective than males when deciding which individuals of the same sex they associate with.[95] Particularly stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young,[92] which can last weeks or months.[100] Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older, males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups.[96][100] Giraffes are not [territorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)),[17] but they have [home ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_range) that vary according to rainfall and proximity to human settlements.[101] Male giraffes occasionally roam far from areas that they normally frequent.[33]: 329

Early biologists suggested giraffes were mute and unable to create enough air flow to vibrate their [vocal folds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_fold).[102] This has been proved to the contrary; they have been recorded to [communicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_communication) using snorts, sneezes, coughs, snores, hisses, bursts, moans, grunts, growls and flute-like sounds.[43][102] During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit bleats, mooing and mewing sounds.[43] Snorting and hissing is associated with vigilance.[103] During nighttime, giraffes appear to [hum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humming) to each other.[104] There is some evidence that giraffes use [Helmholtz resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_resonance) to create [infrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound).[105] They also communicate with body language. [Dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_hierarchy) males display to other males with an erect posture; holding the chin and head up while walking stiffly and displaying their side. The less dominant show submissiveness by dropping the head and ears, lowering the chin and fleeing.[43]

### Reproduction and parental care

Angolan giraffes mating in Namibia

Reproduction in giraffes is broadly [polygamous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexual_behaviour#Polygamy): a few older males mate with the fertile females.[92] Females can reproduce throughout the year and experience [oestrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oestrus) cycling approximately every 15 days.[106][107] Female giraffes in oestrus are dispersed over space and time, so reproductive adult males adopt a strategy of roaming among female groups to seek mating opportunities, with periodic hormone-induced rutting behaviour approximately every two weeks.[108] Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults.[92]

Male giraffes assess female fertility by tasting the female's urine to detect oestrus, in a multi-step process known as the [flehmen response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flehmen_response).[92][100] Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay.[100] A courting male may lick a female's tail, lay his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his ossicones. During copulation, the male stands on his hind legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female's sides.[43]

Giraffe [gestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_(mammals)) lasts 400–460 days, after which a single calf is normally born, although twins occur on rare occasions.[106] The mother gives birth standing up. The calf emerges head and front legs first, having broken through the [fetal membranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_membrane), and falls to the ground, severing the [umbilical cord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_cord).[17] A newborn giraffe is 1.7–2 m (5 ft 7 in – 6 ft 7 in) tall.[47] Within a few hours of birth, the calf can run around and is almost indistinguishable from a one-week-old. However, for the first one to three weeks, it spends most of its time hiding,[109] its coat pattern providing camouflage. The ossicones, which have lain flat in the womb, raise up in a few days.[43]

Female Angolan giraffe with calf

Mothers with calves will gather in nursery herds, moving or browsing together. Mothers in such a group may sometimes leave their calves with one female while they forage and drink elsewhere. This is known as a "[calving pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8che_(zoology))".[109] Calves are at risk of predation, and a mother giraffe will stand over them and kick at an approaching predator.[43] Females watching calving pools will only alert their own young if they detect a disturbance, although the others will take notice and follow.[109] Allo-sucking, where a calf will suckle a female other than its mother, has been recorded in both wild and captive giraffes.[110][111] Calves first ruminate at four to six months and stop [nursing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation) at six to eight months. Young may not reach independence until they are 14 months old.[51]: 49 Females are able to reproduce at four years of age,[43] while [spermatogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatogenesis) in males begins at three to four years of age.[112] Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.[43]

### Necking

Here, male South African giraffes engage in low intensity necking to establish dominance, in [Ithala Game Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithala_Game_Reserve), [Kwa-Zulu-Natal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal), South Africa.

Male giraffes use their necks as [weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_(biology)) in combat, a behaviour known as "necking". Necking is used to establish dominance, and males that win necking bouts have greater [reproductive success](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_success).[10] This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity. In low-intensity necking, the combatants rub and lean on each other. The male that can keep itself more upright wins the bout. In high-intensity necking, the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other, attempting to land blows with their ossicones. The contestants will try to dodge each other's blows and then prepare to counter. The power of a blow depends on the weight of the skull and the arc of the swing.[43] A necking duel can last more than half an hour, depending on how well matched the combatants are.[33]: 331 Although most fights do not lead to serious injury, there have been records of broken jaws, broken necks, and even deaths.[10]

After a duel, it is common for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such interactions between males have been found to be more frequent than heterosexual coupling.[113] In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of [same-sex activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals) varied from 30 to 75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.[114]

### Mortality and health

[Lioness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion) seen with an adult [Masai giraffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masai_giraffe) kill

Giraffes have high adult survival probability,[115] and an unusually long lifespan compared to other ruminants, up to 38 years.[116] Adult female survival is significantly correlated with the number of social associations.[117] Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are mostly safe from predation,[43] with [lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion) being their only major threats.[51]: 55 Calves are much more vulnerable than adults and are also preyed on by [leopards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard), [spotted hyenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_hyena) and [wild dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_dog).[52] A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood.[115][118] Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the [dry season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season) having higher survival rates.[119]

The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory [wildebeests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildebeest) and [zebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra) reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability.[120] In turn, it has been suggested that other ungulates may benefit from associating with giraffes, as their height allows them to spot predators from further away. Zebras were found to assess predation risk by watching giraffes and spend less time looking around when giraffes are present.[121]

Red-billed oxpeckers on a giraffe, Zambia

Some parasites feed on giraffes. They are often [hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(biology)) for [ticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick), especially in the area around the genitals, which have thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera *Hyalomma*, *Amblyomma* and *Rhipicephalus*. [Red-billed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-billed_Oxpecker) and [yellow-billed oxpeckers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-billed_oxpecker) clean giraffes of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasites and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness [rinderpest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinderpest).[17] Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which comes in the form of wrinkles, [lesions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_condition#Lesions) or raw [fissures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_fissure). As much as 79% of giraffes have symptoms of the disease in [Ruaha National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruaha_National_Park), but it did not cause mortality in [Tarangire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarangire_National_Park) and is less prevalent in areas with fertile soils.[122][123][124]

## Human relations

### Cultural significance

With its lanky build and spotted coat, the giraffe has been a source of fascination throughout human history, and its image is widespread in culture. It has represented flexibility, far-sightedness, femininity, fragility, passivity, grace, beauty and the continent of Africa itself.[125]: 7, 116

[San rock art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_rock_art) in Namibia depicting a giraffe

Giraffes were depicted in art throughout the African continent,.[125]: 45–47 The [Kiffians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiffian_culture) were responsible for a life-size rock engraving of two giraffes, dated 8,000 years ago, that has been called the "world's largest rock art petroglyph".[125]: 45[126] Judging from evidence including incised clay pots, archaeologists now believe that, in the ancient [Kushite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Kush) societies located in [Nubia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubia), or what is now northern Sudan, giraffes may have featured in popular religion and women's religion, though not in elite or royal religion, and may have also had a connection to beliefs about the sun.[127] The [Tugen people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tugen_people) of modern Kenya used the giraffe to depict their god Mda.[128] The [Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt) gave the giraffe its own [hieroglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs); 'sr' in [Old Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Egyptian_language) and 'mmy' in later periods.[125]: 49 How the giraffe got its height has been the subject of various [African folktales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Africa#Folklore_and_religion).[10]

Giraffes have a presence in modern [Western culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture). [Salvador Dalí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD) depicted them with burning manes in some surrealist paintings. Dali considered the giraffe to be a masculine symbol. A flaming giraffe was meant to be a "masculine cosmic apocalyptic monster".[125]: 123 Several children's books feature the giraffe, including David A. Ufer's *The Giraffe Who Was Afraid of Heights*, [Giles Andreae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giles_Andreae)'s *Giraffes Can't Dance* and [Roald Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Dahl)'s *The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me*. Giraffes have appeared in animated films as minor characters in [Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney)'s *Dumbo* and *The Lion King*, and in more prominent roles in *The Wild* and the *Madagascar* films. [Sophie the Giraffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_the_Giraffe) has been a popular [teether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teether) since 1961. Another famous fictional giraffe is the Toys "R" Us mascot [Geoffrey the Giraffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toys_%22R%22_Us#Mascot).[125]: 127

The giraffe has also been used for some scientific experiments and discoveries. Scientists have used the properties of giraffe skin as a model for [astronaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit) and [fighter pilot suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_suit) because the people in these professions are in danger of passing out if blood rushes to their legs.[49]: 76 Computer scientists have modeled the coat patterns of several subspecies using [reaction–diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion) mechanisms.[129] The [constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation) of [Camelopardalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelopardalis), introduced in the 17th century, depicts a giraffe.[125]: 119–20 The [Tswana people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tswana_people) of Botswana traditionally see the constellation [Crux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux) as two giraffes—[Acrux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrux) and [Mimosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Crucis) forming a male, and [Gacrux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacrux) and [Delta Crucis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Crucis) forming the female.[130]

### Captivity

The Egyptians were among the earliest people to keep giraffes in captivity and shipped them around the Mediterranean.[125]: 48–49 The giraffe was among the many animals collected and [displayed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_Fragment_with_Man_Leading_a_Giraffe_(Art_Institute_of_Chicago)) by the Romans. The first one in Rome was brought in by [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar) in 46 BC.[125]: 52 With the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire), the housing of giraffes in Europe declined.[125]: 54 During the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages), giraffes were known to Europeans through contact with the Arabs, who revered the giraffe for its peculiar appearance.[52]

Individual captive giraffes were given celebrity status throughout history. In 1414, a giraffe from [Malindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malindi) was [taken to China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_voyages) by explorer [Zheng He](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_He) and placed in a [Ming dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty) zoo. The animal was a source of fascination for the Chinese people, who associated it with the mythical [Qilin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qilin).[125]: 56 The [Medici giraffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medici_giraffe) was a giraffe presented to [Lorenzo de' Medici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_de%27_Medici) in 1486. It caused a great stir on its arrival in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence).[131] [Zarafa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarafa_(giraffe)), another famous giraffe, was brought from [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Egypt_under_the_Muhammad_Ali_dynasty) to Paris in the early 19th century as a gift for [Charles X of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_X_of_France). A sensation, the giraffe was the subject of numerous memorabilia or "giraffanalia".[125]: 81

Giraffes have become popular attractions in modern [zoos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo), though keeping them is difficult as they prefer large areas and need to eat large amounts of browse. Captive giraffes in North America and Europe appear to have a higher mortality rate than in the wild, the most common causes being poor husbandry, nutrition, and management.[51]: 153 Giraffes in zoos display [stereotypical behaviours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypy_(non-human)), particularly the licking of inanimate objects and pacing.[51]: 164 Zookeepers may offer various activities to stimulate giraffes, including training them to take food from visitors.[51]: 167, 176 [Stables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable) for giraffes are built particularly high to accommodate their height.[51]: 183

### Exploitation

Giraffes were probably common targets for hunters throughout Africa.[33]: 337 Different parts of their bodies were used for different purposes.[17] Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs were [flyswatters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyswatter), bracelets, necklaces, and threads. Shields, sandals, and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons.[17][33]: 337 In [Buganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buganda), the smoke of burning giraffe skin was traditionally used to treat nosebleeds.[33]: 337 The [Humr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humur) people of [Kordofan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kordofan) consume the drink Umm Nyolokh, which is prepared from the [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver) and [bone marrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow) of giraffes. [Richard Rudgley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rudgley) hypothesised that Umm Nyolokh might contain [DMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine).[132] The drink is said to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts, by the [Humr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humr).[133]

## Conservation status

In 2016, giraffes were assessed as [Vulnerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species) from a conservation perspective by the [International Union for Conservation of Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature) (IUCN).[1] In 1985, it was estimated there were 155,000 giraffes in the wild. This declined to over 140,000 in 1999.[134] Estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of *Giraffa* in the wild.[135][136] The Masai and reticulated subspecies are [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species),[137][138] and the Rothschild subspecies is [near threatened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-threatened_species).[32] The Nubian subspecies is [critically endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_endangered).[139] In 2025, the IUCN currently accepted four species of giraffe with seven subspecies.[1][140]

Endangered [West African giraffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_African_giraffe) near [Koure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kour%C3%A9), Niger

The primary causes for giraffe population declines are [habitat loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction) and direct killing for [bushmeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushmeat) markets. Giraffes have been [extirpated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction) from much of their historic range, including [Eritrea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea), [Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea), [Mauritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania) and [Senegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal).[1] They may also have disappeared from [Angola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola), [Mali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali), and [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria), but have been introduced to [Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda) and [Eswatini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eswatini).[1][139] As of 2010[update], there were more than 1,600 in captivity at [Species360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species360)-registered zoos.[28] Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe. In the [Sahel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel), the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation). Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they avoid direct competition by feeding above them.[36] In 2017, severe droughts in northern Kenya led to increased tensions over land and the killing of wildlife by herders, with giraffe populations being particularly hit.[141]

Protected areas like national parks provide important habitat and anti-[poaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching) protection to giraffe populations.[1] Community-based conservation efforts outside national parks are also effective at protecting giraffes and their habitats.[142][143] Private game reserves have contributed to the preservation of giraffe populations in eastern and southern Africa.[36] The giraffe is a protected species in most of its range. It is the [national animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_animal) of Tanzania,[144] and is protected by law,[145] and unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment.[146] The UN-backed Convention of Migratory Species selected giraffes for protection in 2017.[147] In 2019, giraffes were listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ([CITES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES)), which means international trade including in parts/derivatives is regulated.[148]

[Translocations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translocation_(Wildlife_conservation)) are sometimes used to augment or re-establish diminished or extirpated populations, but these activities are risky and difficult to undertake using the best practices of extensive pre- and post-translocation studies and ensuring a viable founding population.[149][150] Aerial survey is the most common method of monitoring giraffe population trends in the vast roadless tracts of African landscapes, but aerial methods are known to undercount giraffes. Ground-based survey methods are more accurate and can be used in conjunction with aerial surveys to make accurate estimates of population sizes and trends.[151]

# 10 giraffe facts!

## Discover ten fascinating facts about giraffes!

It’s time for the lowdown on one of nature’s gentle giants! Check out our ten facts about the beautiful giraffe…

## Giraffe facts

1) Giraffes are found in the dry savannahs of Africa, where they roam among the open plains and woodlands.

2) Well known for their long necks, these gentle giants are the world’s tallest living land animals. An adult male can grow to around 5.5m – that’s taller than three adult humans!

3) A giraffe’s height is helpful for keeping a look out for predators, such as lions and hyenas. Their excellent eyesight allows them to spot hungry beasts from far away, too.

4) Herbivores, giraffes only eat plants. Their favourite grub is the acacia tree, and they use their long necks to reach the leaves and buds in the treetops. Their long tongues (which grow to a whopping 53cm!) also help them pull down leaves growing way up high.

5) And boy do these guys have an appetite! They spend most of their time eating, and can guzzle up to 45kg of leaves and twigs a day!

Did you know that we have a FREE downloadable giraffe primary resource? Great for teachers, homeschoolers and parents alike!

6) Whilst they may eat a lot, giraffes don’t drink much water. This is because they get most of their water from their leafy meals, and only need to drink once every few days.

7) Giraffes are very social animals and roam around in groups. These groups, called towers, typically have around 15 members led by an adult male. The other members are females and young males.

8) To see who is stronger, males (called bulls) fight by butting their long necks and heads. This is known as “necking“. These fights aren’t usually dangerous, and end when one bull admits defeat and walks away.

9) Female giraffes give birth standing up. The result? Newborns are welcomed to the world with a 1.5m drop to the ground! Ouch! But these infants are quick to get on their feet – within 30 minutes they are standing, and only hours later they”re able to run with their mothers.

10) In the wild these beautiful creatures live for around 25 years. In captivity they live longer, and have been known to reach 40 years old.

**Content:**
- There are four distinct giraffe species: the Masai giraffe (*Giraffa tippelskirchi*), northern giraffe (*Giraffa camelopardalis*), reticulated giraffe (*Giraffa reticulata*), and southern giraffe (*Giraffa giraffa*).
- Sadly, giraffe are already extinct in at least seven African countries.
- Even with all four species combined, there are only approximately 140,000 giraffe remaining in all of Africa.
- Just like human fingerprints, each giraffe has a unique coat pattern.
- Giraffe feet are surprisingly large, with a diameter of 30 cm, comparable to the size of a dinner plate.
- The giraffe’s tongue is bluish-purple and measures between 45 and 50 cm in length.
- Both male and female giraffe are born with horn-like protrusions called ossicones, initially lying flat and unattached to the skull to prevent injury during birth and later fused to the skull as the giraffe matures.
- The giraffe holds the distinction of being the world’s tallest mammal, with even newborn giraffe surpassing the height of most humans.
- Female giraffe give birth while standing, with their young dropping about 2 meters to the ground. Remarkably, within an hour of birth, these calves can stand on their own.
- Giraffe have a unique challenge when it comes to drinking. Their necks are too short to reach the ground, so they must splay their forelegs and/or bend their knees to lower their necks to the water’s surface.
- Giraffe surprisingly drink only once every few days, even when water is readily available. Evidence suggests that many giraffe do not drink regularly, and sometimes not at all.
- To protect the giraffe’s brain from sudden changes in blood pressure while drinking, its jugular veins have elastic walls and large one-way valves. These adaptations allow the veins to expand significantly and prevent blood from flowing back to the brain when the giraffe’s head is lowered.
- Giraffe have evolved remarkable adaptations to manage blood circulation in their long necks and legs. Their blood vessels are thick-walled and muscular, and the skin on their legs is so tight that it acts like giant compression socks, helping to fight gravity and return blood to the heart. These unique features have inspired scientists at NASA in designing human space suits.
- The giraffe’s heart, weighing approximately 11 kilograms, has a much thicker muscle on its left side compared to other mammals. This adaptation allows the heart to generate enough force to pump blood against gravity throughout the giraffe’s long body.

##### Did you know?

### Giraffe populations have declined by up to 95% in some areas.

In the BBC documentary “Giraffe: Africa’s Gentle Giants”—featuring GCF’s important work in Africa—Sir David Attenborough referred to this decline as a “Silent Extinction.” These alarming numbers serve as a reminder that we need to protect giraffe now before it is too late.

- Both male and female giraffe are born with horn-like protrusions called ossicones, initially lying flat and unattached to the skull to prevent injury during birth and later fused to the skull as the giraffe matures.
- The giraffe holds the distinction of being the world’s tallest mammal, with even newborn giraffe surpassing the height of most humans.
- Female giraffe give birth while standing, with their young dropping about 2 meters to the ground. Remarkably, within an hour of birth, these calves can stand on their own.
- Giraffe have a unique challenge when it comes to drinking. Their necks are too short to reach the ground, so they must splay their forelegs and/or bend their knees to lower their necks to the water’s surface.
- Giraffe surprisingly drink only once every few days, even when water is readily available. Evidence suggests that many giraffe do not drink regularly, and sometimes not at all.
- To protect the giraffe’s brain from sudden changes in blood pressure while drinking, its jugular veins have elastic walls and large one-way valves. These adaptations allow the veins to expand significantly and prevent blood from flowing back to the brain when the giraffe’s head is lowered.
- Giraffe have evolved remarkable adaptations to manage blood circulation in their long necks and legs. Their blood vessels are thick-walled and muscular, and the skin on their legs is so tight that it acts like giant compression socks, helping to fight gravity and return blood to the heart. These unique features have inspired scientists at NASA in designing human space suits.
- The giraffe’s heart, weighing approximately 11 kilograms, has a much thicker muscle on its left side compared to other mammals. This adaptation allows the heart to generate enough force to pump blood against gravity throughout the giraffe’s long body.

### Knowing giraffes

Giraffes are highly social animals and live in herds of 15-20 female giraffes and some young males. Male calves will leave their mothers and the herd from around 15 months and join bachelor herds of other young males. The female calves tend to stay with the same herd as their mothers but can leave after the age of around 18 months old, and most often stay in the same areas as the family herd they grew up in.

Females are ready to mate from four years old and have a gestation period of 15 months – at birth, calves endure an incredible drop of 1.5m to the ground! Newborns weigh around 100kg and can be almost 2m tall at birth but their height will almost double within their first year. Newborns need to be so tall when they are born so they can reach up to suckle; they are reliant on their mother’s milk for the first 9-12 months of life but will start eating leaves from 4 months old.

Neck: One of the distinguishing characteristics of a giraffe is its long neck. This allows giraffes to reach the highest leaves and shoots up in the Acacia tree (their favourite food source), which others browsers cannot reach, whilst also keeping an eye out for predators from their vantage point. The neck is also used for ‘necking’ in Bulls. This is a ritualised fight that appears to help establish dominance, and involves repeatedly swinging their neck to deliver head-butts to the other bull on their body and belly. The giraffe’s neck has a very complex system that regulates their blood pressure, ensuring that plenty of blood gets to their brain but not too much when they bend down to take a drink.

Horns: Giraffes' horns are actually known as ossicones and are found in both males and females, they are formed from ossified cartilage and covered in skin and hair. Both males and females are born with their ossicones but they lie flat at birth and are not attached to the skull in order to avoid injury to themselves and the mother, fusing to the skull as they grow older. Interestingly male giraffes often have thicker ossicones than females, which become bald on top due to frequent necking.

Spots: Each giraffe has a pattern of spots that is completely unique to them, much like a humans’ fingerprint. Their spots also have far more use than the obvious camouflage they provide and around each spot is a large blood vessel which branches off in a complex system of blood vessels underneath the spot. A giraffe can send blood through these smaller blood vessels into the middle of each patch to release heat from the body.

Giraffes use very little communication that can be heard by humans. Mothers will occasionally whistle to warn or call their young but most communication is done infrasonically, with moans and grunts far too low for humans to hear. Giraffes also communicate through different positioning of their eyes and will use prolonged stares to warn other members of the herd to danger.

Giraffes are vital to keeping ecosystems in balance. They eat the browse that others cannot reach, which promotes growth of forage and opens up areas for themselves and other smaller browsers to make use of. Importantly this means that by protecting Africa’s giraffes, we are protecting other species too. Giraffes lives are so intertwined with Acacii trees that some seedlings do not germinate until they have passed through a giraffe's digestive system.

# 7 Things You've Always Wondered About Giraffes

#### Giraffes are amazingly unique animals, with a lot of interesting features and behaviors. Here are 7 things that you may have always been curious about when seeing these lanky long necks.

### 1. Looooong Neck

How many vertebrae, or “neck bones” do you have in your neck? 7! How many does a giraffe have? 7! How about a dog? 7! And a cat? 7! Starting to see a trend here….the only mammals that don’t have 7 are sloths and manatees, but that’s a different story. For giraffes, however, each cervical vertebrae can be over 10 inches long!

### 2. Tongue Tied

Don’t be offended if a giraffe sticks it’s tongue out at you. Giraffes amazing tongue is a uniquely adapted tool to help it reach food. The tongue can measure 18 to 20 inches long and is what is known as “prehensile” allowing it to wrap around branches and pull leaves off. Not only that – it’s built for the sun. The dark coloration of the tongue acts as built in sunscreen protecting it from harmful uv rays – wouldn’t feel to great having a sun-burnt tongue, would it? It can also do...well, this with its tongue.

### 3. Horns? Antlers? Bumpy Heads?

Does a giraffe have horns? Not quite. Giraffe ‘horns’ are not actually called horns, but ‘ossicones’ and both female and male giraffe have them. Ossicones are formed from ossified (hardened into bone) cartilage and are covered in skin.

### 4. Is that a male or a female?

Other than looking underneath the giraffe one way you can tell is by looking at their ossicones. Females’ are often thin and tufted, male giraffe normally have thicker ossicones that become bald on top as a result of frequent necking (fighting with their necks & heads).

### 5. All in the Family

What is the closest relative to a giraffe you ask? The okapi! You might think this animal is more related to a zebra based on its stripes, but it’s sometimes called a forest giraffe.

### 6. Does a Giraffe Ever Sleep?

Short answer – not very often in the wild. Here at the zoo they get more sleep because of a rich diet and a lack of predators that they need to keep an eye open for, but in the wild, giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They often achieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time.

7. What does the giraffe say?!!

Well, not much that we can hear. Other than an occasional grunt or snort, giraffes produce a low humming noise with a sound frequency too low for humans to hear. Try listening really, really hard next time!

Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis): The giraffe is an African mammal and is the tallest living land animal.

Kingdom: | Animalia Phylum: | Chordata Class: | Mammalia Order: | Artiodactyla Family: | Giraffidae Genus: | Giraffa Species: | camelopardalis

A study published in the scientific journal Current Biology in 2016 argues that there are four species of giraffes. However, there is only one species of giraffe currently recognized with nine subspecies.

### Size and Weight:

Giraffes are the tallest land animals. Female giraffes are up to 14 feet tall and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Meanwhile, males are up to 18 feet tall and can weigh 3,000 pounds. At this height, a giraffe can look into a second-story window.

Their neck alone can be 6 feet long, which is taller than the average man and can weigh up to 600 pounds. A giraffe’s legs are also about 6 feet long, allowing them to run quickly. The record running speed of a giraffe is 34.7 miles per hour. A giraffe’s heart is 2 feet long and weighs about 25 pounds. And a giraffe’s lungs can hold 12 gallons of air. A giraffe’s eyes are the size of golf balls.

### Appearance:

Giraffes are known for their long, tall appearance. They have a small hump on their back like a camel and have a spotted pattern similar to that of a leopard. Because of the combination of these features, some people called the giraffe a “camel-leopard.” That’s where the giraffe’s species name “camelopardalis” comes from.

These nine subspecies of giraffe vary in coat patterns and live in different parts of Africa. A giraffe’s coat color can range from light tan to nearly black, depending on what the giraffe eats and where it lives. Giraffe coat colors vary from light tan to practically black. Each giraffe’s markings are as individual as human fingerprints.

For example, the reticulated giraffe, found only in northern Kenya, has a fark coat with a web of narrow white lines, while the Masai giraffe, also found in Kenya, has a pattern that looks similar to oak leaves.

Giraffes have two horns on the top of their head called ossicones. Both males and females have ossicones. Ossicones are covered in skin and fur like the rest of the giraffe’s body. Ossicones start as cartilage and later fuse to the skull as the giraffe ages.

### Diet:

Giraffes are herbivores, feasting on hundreds of pounds of leaves a week and traveling miles in search of food. Their height gives them an advantage over other African herbivores, as they can reach the high branches for young leaves. Their 18-inch tongue helps them reach some of the tougher leaves. It takes a lot to fuel such a large mammal, and a giraffe may eat up to 75 pounds of food per day. A giraffe will spend most of its day eating. Giraffes only need to drink once every several days because they get most of their water from the luscious plants they eat.

Acacia trees host their favorite leaves. While these trees have long thorns, which prevent most animals from eating them, giraffes use their long tongues and prehensile lips to reach around the thorns. The dark color of their tongue is believed to prevent sunburn while reaching for leaves. Giraffes have thick, sticky saliva, which coats any thorns they might swallow.

### Habitat:

Giraffes can be found in African savannas, grasslands and woodlands.

### Geography:

Giraffes can be found throughout sub-Saharan Africa. They are native to many African countries, such as Kenya, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Uganda, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Angola, and South Africa.

### Breeding:

The giraffe gestation period is about 14 months, and an adult female giraffe typically gives birth to one newborn, called a calf, at a time. When a calf is born, it is born feet first, followed by the head, neck, and shoulders. Female giraffes give birth standing up, so the young giraffe starts its life by falling more than 5 feet to the ground. About an hour after birth, the calf can already start to stand up and walk. Within a week, it starts to sample vegetation.

When a calf gets older, the mother leaves her youngster together with other calves in a “nursery.” One of the moms stays to babysit while the others go out to eat and socialize. In the nursery, the calves develop physical and social skills through play. The young giraffes can eat leaves at the age of four months, but continue to nurse until they are six to nine months old. Giraffes hit sexual maturity between 3 and 5 years old.

### Social Structure:

Giraffes are social animals. They live in herds of about 10 to 20 individuals and they can be up to 50 members. Groups of giraffes are called “towers.” Giraffes do not have strong social ties like other animal species, except the mothers with their offspring. Each member of the herd can leave the group at will.

Aside from humans, crocodiles and lions are giraffe’s only predators. However, due to their size, giraffes do not hide from these predators. They are able to protect themselves from predators by staying in groups, as it makes it more challenging for the predator. If they need to defend themselves, giraffes have a deadly, karate-style kick. Giraffes can also run very fast, around 35 mph, for short distances.

### Lifespan:

Giraffes typically live between 15 and 20 years in the wild.

### Threats:

In many African countries, giraffe populations are slowly decreasing. Habitat loss and the overgrazing of resources by livestock are among the largest threats. The future of giraffes is largely dependent on the quality of the habitat that remains. Another major threat is poaching. Giraffes are shot or snared for their meat, hide, bone marrow, and tail hair.

### Conservation Status:

Giraffes are classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN’s Red List. Their population size has been declining in recent years.

### Conservation Efforts:

Conservation groups, including San Diego Zoo Global, are working to protect giraffes. For example, San Diego Zoo Global supports a community conservation effort in northern Kenya that is finding ways for people and wildlife to live together. At the San Diego Zoo, there is a giraffe-feeding patio where biscuits can be purchased and fed to the giraffes. Through the sale of these giraffe biscuits, they are raising money to fund community conservation initiatives that they support in Africa.

Earthday.org provides a list of ways to help protect giraffes:

- Educate all people on how and why to protect giraffes

- Support sustainable agriculture and settlement practices near giraffe habitats

- Reforest key areas with acacia trees that provide giraffes’ main food source

- Stop the poaching of giraffes for their tails, considered status symbols

- Solve hunger in areas like Sudan where impoverished villagers eat giraffe meat

- Reverse climate change that’s causing rising temperatures and widespread drought in Africa

### How You Can Help:

Adopt a Giraffe: Make a symbolic giraffe adoption with the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF).

Support giraffe conservation efforts, such as those with WWF and the San Diego Zoo.

**Source:** web

**Content:**
Many young giraffes, called calves, die from lion attacks during their first year of life. Once a giraffe reaches adulthood its height is often enough to protect it from lions. Adult giraffes, however, must still be careful of lions when they are bending down to drink water or rest. Usually giraffes will drink or rest in shifts so that at least one giraffe is always on the lookout for approaching predators.​

​The giraffes' height and excellent vision give them a wide view of the grasslands where they live, making it easy to spot predators from a distance. Some scientists believe that other animals—such as zebras, antelope, and wildebeests—often congregate near giraffes to take advantage of their ability to see danger from a distance. The giraffe could be considered the early warning system of the African grasslands.

## 15 Amazing Sights to See While Climbing Kilimanjaro

Giraffes, the tallest mammals on Earth, are a common sight on the savannas of Africa.

As Tanzania’s national animal, the giraffe is revered and protected within the country’s borders. The animal represents the ability to be visionary – seeing the past and the present. And so, the giraffe serves as a reminder for Tanzanians to view life from all angles.

Here are 10 facts about giraffes.

## 1. Not One, But Four Species

Giraffes were once classified as a single species with several subspecies, But evidence revealed revealed significant genetic differences between different giraffe populations, which led to a revision in their classification. There are four recognized species of giraffes and nine subspecies.

- Masai Giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi): Known for its jagged-edged spots, the Masai giraffe is found in southern Kenya and Tanzania.

- Southern Giraffe (Giraffa giraffa): This species has two subspecies, the Angolan giraffe and the South African giraffe. It’s characterized by star-shaped patches on a lighter background and is found in southern Africa.

- Northern Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis): This species includes three subspecies: the Nubian giraffe, the Kordofan giraffe, and the West African giraffe. They are distributed across different parts of East and West Africa.

- Reticulated Giraffe (Giraffa reticulata): Distinguished by its clearly defined, reticulated pattern of narrow lines, this species is primarily found in northeastern Kenya, southern Ethiopia, and Somalia.

## 2. Their Spots Are Like Fingerprints

Every giraffe has a unique pattern of spots, much like human fingerprints. These spots, apart from giving them their distinctive look, also help in thermoregulation. The large, irregular patches on their skin are surrounded by a network of blood vessels that aid in releasing excess body heat.

## 3. Giraffes Are Silent Giants

Contrary to popular belief, giraffes are not mute. They use various sounds like moans, snores, hisses, and grunts, especially in social interactions. However, they are generally quiet animals, and much of their communication happens through body language.

## 4. They Have a Height Advantage

Adult giraffes stand at a staggering height of 14 to 19 feet, with their necks alone being about 6 feet long. This height gives them a significant advantage in reaching leaves and buds in treetops that other herbivores can’t reach. But it becomes a hindrance when they drink water as their necks are too short to reach the ground. Therefore, they have to spread their front legs to take a sip.

## 5. Giraffes Have Strong Hearts

Giraffes have a highly specialized cardiovascular system to manage blood flow to their brains over the long journey up their necks. Their hearts are incredibly strong and large, about 2 feet long, and weigh around 25 pounds to efficiently pump blood to great heights.

## 6. They Walk Funny

Giraffes move both legs on one side of their body and then both on the other side, which is known as “pacing” gait. This unique way of walking is thought to provide stability and balance, considering their long limbs and neck.

## 7. Giraffe Tongues Are Specialized

Giraffes primarily feed on the leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, with acacia species being a favorite. Their tongues, which can be up to 18 inches long, help them maneuver around thorns and rugged bark to reach their food.

## 8. Giraffes Sleep Standing Up

Giraffes usually sleep standing up, which helps them quickly escape from predators if needed. They rarely lie down, and when they do, it’s for a short time. They typically sleep for just a few minutes at a time, adding up to about 30 minutes to 2 hours in a 24-hour period, which is one of the shortest sleep requirements in the animal kingdom.

## 9. They Group Together in Towers

Giraffes are social creatures and are often found in groups, known as towers. These groups are usually casual and members may join or leave freely. Female giraffes often form more stable groups, especially when they are raising young.

## 10. Giraffes Drop Their Kids

Giraffe pregnancies last for about 15 months. When giving birth, the female giraffe remains standing, so the newborn’s first experience outside the womb is a 6-foot drop to the ground. This fall helps to break the amniotic sac and cut the umbilical cord, and stimulates the newborn to take its first breaths.

## 11. They Have Strong Kicks

When threatened, a giraffe’s primary form of defense is its powerful legs. A giraffe’s kick can generate enough force to deter most predators, and it has the potential to be lethal. These kicks can be delivered with incredible speed and accuracy, making them a formidable weapon against threats such as lions, the primary predators of giraffes.

## 12. Giraffes Fight By “Necking”

Giraffes have horns known as ossicones. To establish dominance or compete for females, males use their ossicones to engage in combat, called “necking.” During these battles, giraffes swing their long necks, using the weight and momentum to land blows with their heads. The impact can be strong enough to knock an opponent off balance or even cause injury.
