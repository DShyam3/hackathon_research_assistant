**Hello** is a [salutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salutation) or [greeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeting) in the English language. It is first attested in writing from 1826.[1]

The greeting "Hello" became associated with telephones in the late 19th century. Postcard c. 1905–1915

## Early uses

*Hello*, with that spelling, was used in publications in the U.S. as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the *Norwich Courier* of [Norwich, Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich,_Connecticut).[1] Another early use was an 1833 American book called *The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee*,[2] which was reprinted that same year in *The London Literary Gazette*.[3] The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.[4]

## Etymology

According to the *Oxford English Dictionary*, *hello* is an alteration of *hallo*, *hollo*,[1] which came from [Old High German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_High_German) "*halâ*, *holâ*, emphatic imperative of *halôn*, *holôn* to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman".[5] It also connects the development of *hello* to the influence of an earlier form, *holla*, whose origin is in the French *holà* (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French *là* 'there').[6] As in addition to *hello*, *halloo*,[7] *hallo*, *hollo*, *hullo* and (rarely) *hillo* also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.[8][9][10]

### Telephone

Before the telephone, verbal greetings often involved a time of day, such as "good morning". When the telephone began connecting people in different [time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone), greetings without time gained popularity.[11]

[Thomas Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison) is credited with popularizing *hullo* as a telephone greeting. In previous decades, *hullo* had been used as an exclamation of surprise (used early on by [Charles Dickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens) in 1850)[12] and *halloo* was shouted at ferry boat operators by people who wanted to catch a ride.[13] According to one account, *halloo* was the first word Edison yelled into his strip [phonograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph) when he discovered recorded sound in 1877.[12] Shortly after [Alexander Graham Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell) invented the telephone, he answered calls by saying "*ahoy ahoy*", borrowing the term used on ships.[13][14] There is no evidence the greeting caught on.[13] Edison suggested *Hello!* on August 15, 1877, in a letter to the president of [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh)'s Central District and Printing Telegraph Company, T. B. A. David:

> Friend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away. > What you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.[12]

The first name tags to include *Hello* may have been in 1880 at Niagara Falls, which was the site of the first telephone operators convention. By 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as "[hello-girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Girls#History_of_the_term)" because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.[14][15]

A 1918 novel uses the spelling "Halloa" in the context of telephone conversations.[16]

### Hullo, hallo, and other spellings

"Hallo" redirects here. For other uses, see [Hallo (disambiguation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallo_(disambiguation)).

*Hello* might be derived from an older spelling variant, *hullo*, which the American [Merriam-Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam-Webster) dictionary describes as a "chiefly British variant of hello",[17] and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. *Hullo* is found in publications as early as 1803.[18] The word *hullo* is still in use, with the meaning *hello*.[19][20][21][22]

*Hello* is alternatively thought to come from the word *hallo* (1840) via *hollo* (also *holla*, *holloa*, *halloo*, *halloa*).[23] The definition of *hollo* is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a [hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_hunt) when the quarry was spotted:[24][25]

> If I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.

— Coriolanus (I.viii.7), William Shakespeare

[Fowler's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%27s) has it that "hallo" is first recorded "as a shout to call attention" in 1864.[26] It is used by [Samuel Taylor Coleridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge)'s famous poem *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner* written in 1798:

> And the good south wind still blew behind, > But no sweet bird did follow,  > Nor any day for food or play  >  > Came to the mariners' hollo!

In many [Germanic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages), including German, [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language), [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language), [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language) and [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans_language), "*hallo*" directly translates into English as "hello". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from [Willem Bilderdijk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Bilderdijk) to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment.[27]

[Webster's dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%27s_dictionary) from 1913 traces the etymology of *holloa* to the Old English *halow* and suggests: "Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā".

According to the *American Heritage Dictionary*, *hallo* is a modification of the obsolete *holla* (*stop!*), perhaps from Old French *hola* (*ho*, ho! + *la*, there, from Latin *illac*, that way).[28]

### "Hello, World" computer program

Main article: ["Hello, World!" program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)

Students learning a new computer [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) will often begin by writing a "Hello, World!" program, which does nothing but issue the message "Hello, World!" to the user (such as by displaying it on a screen). It has been used since the earliest programs, and in many computer languages. This tradition was further popularised after being printed in an introductory chapter of the book *The C Programming Language* by [Brian Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) and [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie).[29] The book had reused an example taken from a 1974 memo by Kernighan at [Bell Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs).[30]

## Writing and composition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hello_(Adele_song)&action=edit&section=1)]

"Hello" A 21-second sample of the chorus from "Hello", where Adele is singing the lines over layers of backing vocals, piano and drums "towards a very luscious wall of sound".[10] Problems playing this file? See media help.

"Hello" was written by Adele and [Greg Kurstin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kurstin) and produced by Kurstin, who also played bass, guitar, drums, piano and keyboards, while Adele played drums.[11] "Hello" was written in [Chiswick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiswick), London, something not normally done by Adele, who said she likes to write her music at home.[12] The writing process for the song was slow, taking six months to complete. Initially Adele and Kurstin started writing the first verse; finishing half of the song, six months later Adele contacted Kurstin to finish the song with her, with Kurstin stating he was not sure "if Adele was ever going to come back and finish it."[13]

"Hello" is a [soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music) piano ballad,[2][14] played in the key of [F minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_minor) at a tempo of 79 beats per minute. The repeated chord progression heard in the verse, played by the piano, follows two progressions and a passage (Bridge) progression (passage or Bridge progression connects two main progressions to each other) of Progression #1: Fm(i)–A♭(III)–E♭(VII)–D♭(VI), Passage progression: Fm(i)–E♭(VII)-Cm(v)-D♭(VI)-Fm7(i7)-E♭(VII)–D♭(VI), Progression #2:Fm(i)–D♭/F(VI)–A♭(III)–E♭(VII). According to Musicnotes.com, Adele's vocals span from F3 to A♭5 in the song.[15] During the [chorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrain), Adele is heard singing the lines over layers of backing vocals, piano and drums which were described by *The Daily Telegraph* as having "a very luscious wall of sound".[10]

Lyrically, the song focuses on themes of nostalgia and regret, and was seen as a follow-up to her single "Someone like You" appearing to reflect on a failed relationship. The song's lyrics were also seen as being conversational, revolving around "all the relationships of her past", ranging from friends, family members and ex-partners.[16] Speaking on the song's lyrical content, Adele told [Nick Grimshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Grimshaw) on *The Radio 1 Breakfast Show*: "I felt all of us were moving on, and it's not about an ex-relationship, a love relationship, it's about my relationship with everyone that I love. It's not that we have fallen out, we've all got our lives going on and I needed to write that song so they would all hear it, because I'm not in touch with them."[17] According to Adele, the line "Hello from the other side" signifies "the other side of becoming an adult, making it out alive from your late teens, early twenties."[13]

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hello_(Adele_song)&action=edit&section=2)]

On 18 October 2015, a 30-second clip of "Hello" was played during a commercial break on *The X Factor* in the United Kingdom. The commercial teased what was then new material, with her vocals accompanied by lyrics on a black screen.[18] Josh Duboff of *Vanity Fair* wrote that "the Internet collectively lost their minds" after the broadcast of the trailer.[19] On 22 October, Adele announced the upcoming release of *25* to her fans on Twitter. She also shared that "Hello" would be released on 23 October as the lead single off of the album.[20][21][22] On 23 October, Adele joined [Nick Grimshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Grimshaw)'s show on [BBC Radio 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_1) for the song's premiere.[23][24]

## Critical reception

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hello_(Adele_song)&action=edit&section=3)]

"Hello" received universal critical acclaim.[25][26][27][28] [Alexis Petridis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Petridis) of *The Guardian* described it as "a big ballad, but a superior example of its kind", and opined that the song is "precisely the kind of lovelorn epic ballad that made Adele one of the biggest stars in the world."[29] Writing for *The Independent*, Emily Jupp stated in her review of the song that it "might not be groundbreaking, but Adele's return with her familiar, smoky sound is very welcome". She called it an "'if it ain't broke' ballad" and said: "Adele does what she does best, belting out emotional tales of love and loss much the same as with her last album, *21*, but this time, with a little more self-forgiveness."[30]

[Greg Kot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kot) of the *Chicago Tribune* wrote: "Lyrics that work best when they zoom in on personal details match her combination of vocal power and restraint."[31] Neil McCormick from *The Daily Telegraph* called it "a beautiful song of loss and regret", adding that "it takes a grip on the kind of memory every listener holds somewhere in their heart and merges it with Adele's own drama."[10] *Rolling Stone* ranked "Hello" at number 6 on its year-end list to find the 50 best songs of 2015.[32] Several publications have commented on similarities in the theme of the song and accompanying video with that of "[Hello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_(Lionel_Richie_song))" by American singer [Lionel Richie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Richie).[33][34]

In 2021, *Parade* ranked the song number 12 on their list of the 25 greatest Adele songs,[35] and in 2022, *American Songwriter* ranked the song number three on their list of the 10 greatest Adele songs.[36]

## Music video

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hello_(Adele_song)&action=edit&section=8)]

> "When I heard the song I saw a story right away. [The video] is highly unoriginal. The lyrics are 'Hello, it's me' and then you see someone picking up a phone. I'm not good at imagining super conceptual videos. I just thought it would be nice to have her walk around the house and make phone calls and end up in a forest, with maybe some flashbacks in it."

— Xavier Dolan, behind the concept of the music video[89]

The accompanying music video for "Hello" was directed by Canadian actor and filmmaker Xavier Dolan and released on 23 October 2015, despite the fact the song was released as a single a day later.[90][91] The concept of the video revolves around a recently broken-up young woman calling a younger version of herself.[89] Portions of the video—mostly the finale on the pond and the shot of her opening her eyes in the beginning—were filmed with [IMAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX) cameras, making it the first music video in IMAX format.[92] The video draws inspiration from Dolan's semi-autobiographical debut *I Killed My Mother*, which was made when Dolan was barely 20.[89] The video was filmed on a farm in [Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec) over four days in September 2015.[89]

The video stars American actor [Tristan Wilds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Wilds). According to Dolan, Adele called him after an unspecified incident of [police brutality in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality_in_the_United_States), suggesting that a white male not be cast as her love interest in the video. Dolan elaborated "She was just like, 'I'm concerned with the reality of the tensions between authorities and the black community, and I want to send a message out there.'"[93][94] Dolan contacted Wilds via Skype and explained the concept for the video, which Wilds agreed to take part in.[95] During the filming, both Adele and Wilds were asked to improvise and "tap into" their past relationships to convey the correct emotions. Dolan also filmed shots of both Adele and Wilds having conversations and laughing.[95] The [sepia toned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepia_tone) video shows Adele performing the song in a small house and outside in a wooded forest, intercut with scenes of her making a tearful phone call and flashbacks to a past relationship with Wilds' character.[96]

The [flip phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_phone) used by Adele in the video was widely commented upon due to being of a [retro style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro_style). Dolan replied to the remarks by saying: "It makes me uncomfortable filming iPhones because I feel like I'm shooting a commercial. Those things: iPhones, laptops, all those elements, to me, they bring me back to reality: That's not what you want. You want to get out of your own life; you want to enter someone else's; you want to travel somewhere; you want to be told a story. I'm realizing maybe I've been more distracting than anything else with that flip phone, but it wasn't intentional!"[97]

The music video for "Hello" broke the previous [Vevo Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vevo_Record) by achieving over 27.7 million views within its first 24 hours of release. This record was previously held by the music video for [Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift)'s "[Bad Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood_(Taylor_Swift_song))", which had amassed 20.1 million views in its first 24 hours.[98] Later, the video continued to break [Miley Cyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miley_Cyrus)' "[Wrecking Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrecking_Ball_(Miley_Cyrus_song))" Vevo record for the fastest video to reach 100 million views in five days.[99] The phrase "Adele hello" was also the top YouTube search term of Friday and Saturday, and on average the video was getting one million views per hour during the first two days, peaking at 1.6 million in a single hour, beating the peak view rate of the trailer for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, which peaked at 1.2 million views per hour.[100] The video was parodied in a [Thanksgiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving)-themed sketch on *Saturday Night Live*.[101]

The video peaked as the [30th most viewed video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos) on YouTube in 2020,[102] having earned over 2.8 billion views, as well as the [26th most liked video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-liked_YouTube_videos) on the platform in 2015, with over 17 million likes.[103][104] The video holds the Guinness world record for the "fastest time for a video to reach 1 billion views" in 87 days.[4]

"**Hello**" is a song by American singer and songwriter [Lionel Richie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Richie). Taken as the third single from his second solo album, *Can't Slow Down* (1983), the song was released in 1984 and reached number one on three *Billboard* music charts: the [pop chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100) (for two weeks), the [R&B chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_R%26B/Hip-Hop_Songs) (for three weeks),[4] and the [Adult Contemporary chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Contemporary_(chart)) (for six weeks). The song also went to number one on the [UK Singles Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart) for six weeks.[5]

The song was subject to a lawsuit by songwriter Marjorie Hoffman White, who accused Richie of plagiarizing her 1978 composition "I'm Not Ready to Go".[6]

## Reception

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hello_(Lionel_Richie_song)&action=edit&section=1)]

*Cash Box* said that the song "is as melodic and heartwrenching as anything [Ritchie] has done previously and that’s saying something."[7]

## Composition

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hello_(Lionel_Richie_song)&action=edit&section=2)]

The song is written in the key of [A minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_minor).[8] The verses follow the [chord progression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression) of Am9—Cmaj7/G—Fmaj7—C6/G—Fmaj7. The chorus features a [Neapolitan chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_chord) (Bb).[9]

## Music video

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hello_(Lionel_Richie_song)&action=edit&section=3)]

The [music video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video) for "Hello", directed by [Bob Giraldi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Giraldi), features the story of Richie as a theater and acting teacher having a seemingly unrequited love for a blind student (Laura Carrington) until he discovers she shares the feeling as demonstrated by the discovery that she is sculpting a likeness of his head in clay.

## Legacy

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hello_(Lionel_Richie_song)&action=edit&section=4)]

The song is memorable for the line "Hello, is it me you're looking for?"[citation needed] The phrase started the song's composition, as when [James Anthony Carmichael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anthony_Carmichael) visited Richie, the singer greeted him that way, to which Carmichael replied, "Finish that song." Richie initially felt that the song was "corny" but ultimately "by the time I finished the verse, I fell in love with the song again."[10] Several publications have commented on similarities in the theme of the song and accompanying video with that of "[Hello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_(Adele_song))" by British singer [Adele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele), the latter of which was released 31 years later.[11][12]
