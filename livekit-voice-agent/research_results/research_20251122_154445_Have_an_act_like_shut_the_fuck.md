The Art of Shutting the Fuck Up

```
“Never miss a good chance to shut the fuck up." -  Will Rogers
   
"To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be credible; to be credible we must be truthful.  At all other times it is essential to shut the fuck up." - Edward R. Murrow
 

It’s all too true that Silence is golden, but each of us knows that a fool and his/her gold are quickly parted.  
   
I hear everyone talking about this and that and what their opinions are on the state of things, all these thoughts and intricate feelings they’re having.  But, I gotta ask: have they ever thought about just shutting the fuck up?  Seriously now.  Do they ever wonder what will happen if they just shut the fuck up?  Will the world stop or shift radically on its axis?  Will the sun go out?  Will the world be less rich and textural without his amateur standup routine or her endless whining about her grim love life?  Would it hurt anything- or anyone- if they just generally shut the fuck up a lot more than they do?  
    
I’m picturing it now.  But my ability to concentrate on this picture is fractured by the sound of someone’s goddamned mouth!
   
What!?
 
Does your mouth fear it will die from lack of exercise?  Are you afraid my ears will feel empty without your words filling them?  Conversation ain’t noise pollution, someone once said.  The key word here is conversation: the lost art.   I require, ne demand, stimulation during a conversation, but you, dear insensate being, only stimulate me to pull my ears off (followed by your lips and tongue), and shove them all UP your throat by way of your ass.
   
We Neurosicrucians place a high value on shutting the fuck up and one of our most recurring thoughts, as an organization, is that we want more — more collective STFU, more silent spaces, more stifling en masse and more techniques to shut these forces down when their lips and tongues are generating too much waste material for our ears to sanely process.
   
What’s it going to take? Do we have to create a behavioral modification center so radical that you learn how to keep your prolific gob shut by cattle prod or our patented High Db Cognitive Restructuring?  A gloomy place, in a cavernous storage facility (filled floor to ceiling with the cages that will be your sleeping pods) where you can engage with others like you who just cannot seem to shut the fuck up?  Do you need a rehab program for people, like yourself, who can’t get a handle on the fact that nobody cares what they really think most of the time anyway?  Okay.  You’re asking for it and… boy… have we responded!  That very place has been created and, thank the Pantheon, is located in Nelsonville, Ohio... twenty miles underground and far away from decent people.  It’s a place of enforced listening and mandatory introspection. For those who don’t respond to the above mentioned techniques, we’ll just keep your mouth full and your mind occupied, so you’ll have no choice.
   
Well, we’re listening…
   
No we’re not.  So, SHUT THE FUCK UP.
 
Air pollution from NON STOP BULLSHITTING is ten times higher inside designated socializing areas like bars, offices and living rooms than it is in Mexico City. Have you ever been at a tailgate party?  Why do you think everybody gets so drunk?  Often, alcohol as a "tonic," brings all the bullshit to the forefront, forcing expulsion in great roaring flares from the monstrous orificia of all involved.  The participants are literally bathed in these toxins, rendering them immune to their own verbally transmitted poisons.  Otherwise sensible humanimals are alchemically transmogrified into superhuman bullshit dozers who’ll annihilate any type of quietly meaningful thought processes under their rusted, crippling tracks and blades without a thought or care.  
 
Average air pollution levels from mindless chatter directly outside designated socializing areas, like bathrooms, are also about three times higher than levels in graveyards, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Why’s this, you ask?  Because some people can’t even shut the fuck up IN THE BATHROOM!  I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to chat about the decline in the quality of the American moral code while I’m trying to pinch off what ails me.  What's more disturbing is that the current ‘noisy ghost’ trend seems to indicate people aren't even shutting the fuck up after they've expired.  This is truly a low-tide benchmark in our civilization.
 
A study conducted in five large hub U.S. bullshit capitals also showed that air toxicity levels inside key bullshit zones were 23 times higher than levels in Chernobyl.  In the study, conducted by an elite team of degreed and tenured bullshitters, designated bullshit zones included business and governmental districts as well as major college campuses in most major cities.  The prognosis is grim indeed.
 
What’s most alarming: all the most toxic bullshit zones in the United States are infested by the public with no escape plan for those who don’t trade in that currency.  In the listing and lurid world of the future, the reserved and the prudent will have no respite.  
 
A GOOD RULE OF FIST: When in doubt: shut the fuck up.
When you don’t know what to say: shut the fuck up.
When someone else is talking: shut the fuck up.
When you’re in a bad mood: shut the fuck up.
When you’re in a good mood: shut the fuck up.   
When you’re sick:  stay home and keep that filthy blow hole- that sadly only exists to spread discontent and germs- CLOSED (or packed with, preferably, a whole box of Kleenex brand antiviral tissue).
    
Absorption of someone’s bullshit causes heart disease and all types of cancer in both smoking and nonsmoking adults living in Oregon, so that should tell you something.  Verbal diarrhea (a.k.a. not knowing when to shut the fuck up) is the LEADING cause of sudden tragic death syndrome (or STDS), respiratory problems, constipation and nervous collapses in “people who are too big for their britches.”   Infants, houseplants, family pets as well as the insane are often immune to the effects of bullshit avalanches.  Even brief exposure to some forms of bullshit can trigger acute cardiac events such as a white knuckled heart vs. brain death match.  Useless chatter kills an estimated 443,000 Americans (not to mention a staggering one trillion new ideas) each year, including 46,000 misunderstanding deaths and 3,400 he-said she-said deaths among non-bullshitters from exposure to secondhand bullshit.
   
Having a big fucking mouth affects people of all ages, races and economic levels. An advanced education doesn’t help- it even seems to aggravate a preexisting condition.  Excessive expression, fact quotation and other idle talk can lead to psychological, social, work, financial, legal, and physical problems or make a person into a psychiatrist, social worker, financial ANALyst, physical therapist or- the lowliest of all the motor mouths- lawyers. Talk for talk’s sake is a crime against introspection and thoughtfulness and ultimately, against Humanimality itself.
   
There are even times that voicing your opinion can lead to death or incarceration- and maybe it’s for the best.  But the point we’re addressing here is this: it takes strength to stop and shut the fuck up.  And I’ve got news for you… you won’t receive much support in this undertaking.  You’ll have to invent creative resources to help yourself (or a loved one, if you dare).  You’ll be vilified and outcast.  Filling the mouth is okay as long as it’s not with something equally as addictive as senseless bullshit.  Good luck with this.  Food is certainly an option, but you don’t want all those stuffed opinions going directly to your ass do you?  Gum is ok… if it didn’t destroy both your stomach and your teeth.  An adult pacifier is recommended as a starter M.F-er, but you must stop using it at once if you find yourself getting constant ear infucktions or developing a speech impediment.  I find that injecting the nipple with sizzurp helps at least in the beginning phase.  The effect of your paci on others will undoubtedly stir comments out of your fellow bullshitters.  You won't win any popularity contests if you stick to your guns... but this will bring the humility and "down time" necessary to travel this glorious new path.   Warning: these “pre-loaded” pacis are, admittedly, great for parties but they tend to be ice breakers (for better or worse) thus throwing you back into the cycle of inane conversation, verbal one-upmanship.  ‘But’, you say, ‘it’s a party’.  Parties are for showing off your shiny personality, right?  Imagine going to a party and actually listening to people.  Might people think you’re boring if you’re not showcasing your STAND-UP-ROUTINE-PERSONA?  Let’s face it, at that point you’re positively ate up with Everyman’s Disease, and you might as well ‘join the group’.

**All For One:** This... Is MY TALE! Out of my Way! You EXTRA! YOU NOBODY!**Dynamight:** SHUT THE HELL UP! — My Hero Academia

When you don't have anything smarter to say. Basically, someone screams "Shut up!" at another person (or group of people) when annoyed, upset, or pissed off, and occasionally followed up by [trying to attack said someone](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkToTheFist). Could also be uttered when trying to put a [Superpowered Evil Side](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide) in its place. Variations include: "SHUT THE HELL/FUCK UP!", "QUIET!", "SHUT YOUR (DAMN/FUCKING) MOUTH/FACE!", *STOP!*, "SILENCE!", "ENOUGH!", etc. The Japanese version, very common, is "*URUSAI!*", literally "noisy!" Occasionally applied literally to [Shut Up, Hannibal!](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal) or [Shut Up, Kirk!](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpKirk). ["Shut Up!" Gunshot](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpGunshot) is this when it's done with firearms.

TAKE IT OUTSIDE!" - *Lamput*: In "Meet the Shrink", the shrink yells at Lamput and the docs ([in gibberish](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakingSimlish), as usual for this show) to stop ruining his room, also holding up his hand in the "stop" position. - *Motu Patlu (2012)*: In "John Banega Don", Inspector Chingum asks Motu and Patlu who threw a suitcase on his head. Motu and Patlu struggle to tell him who threw the suitcase before Chingum shouts "SHUT UP!!!" at them.

Comedy

- [Bill Cosby](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby) talks about mothers during the concert film *Bill Cosby: Himself*, one of his famous concerts. "And that's another thing, they ask you a question, you try and answer, they tell you to shut up. 'Day and night, night and day, work my fingers to the bone for what?!' 'I don't-' 'SHUT. UP. Now when I ask you a question, you keep your trap SHUT! Think I'm talking just to hear myself talk?! ANSWER ME!'" - In the "Sister Mary Elephant" sketch from the [Cheech & Chong](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CheechAndChong) album *Big Bambu*, a substitute teacher, faced with a class of unruly teenagers, repeatedly invokes this trope, with the screaming at even higher decibel levels as the skit progresses: "Class... Class... Cla-ass... SSSSSHHHHAAAADDDDUPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" [silence] "Thank you." - "Shut Up, Little Man!" featuring Raymond Huffman and Peter Haskett as recorded by Eddie Lee Sausage, is all about this trope. [Here's Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJspYSFBxtk). - A common staple in [Ross Noble](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RossNoble)'s stand-up shows is him shouting at the audience to shut up when he's trying to say something somewhat serious or when they notice a joke he didn't intend (usually rude). Unfortunately this only makes them laugh more. SHUT YER FACES!

Zor-El was a father to me in that damn bottle!

Fan Works

### Crossovers

- *Amazing Fantasy*: Izuku's muttering about his new "Quirk" in the middle of lunch pisses off Bakugou enough to yell "SHUT THE HELL UP!" while throwing an explosion at Izuku's head. This manages to trigger Izuku's Spider-Sense for the first time, leading to a chain reaction that ends with Izuku accidentally destroying his desk with his Spider-Strength before darting out the door to avoid Bakugou's wrath. Peter's constant quipping manages to grate on Prowler's nerves even though she can't understand a word of it. She soon shouts "DAMARE!"note "Silence!" or "Shut it!" while chasing Peter through Musutafu. - *Avengers: Infinite Wars*: [Natasha Romanov](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackWidow) isn't one to raise her voice that often, but when the grand meeting to discuss a ceasefire between the [Galactic Republic and the Confederation of Independent Systems](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars) in the wake of Ultron's genocidal rampage across the galaxy dissolves into petty sqabbling, she shuts up the ENTIRE SENATE CHAMBER with one big **QUIET**. She follows up with scolding *every single member of both sides present* to be more immature than her adopted daughter Mara Jade, who is just 1 year old by this point in time. - *Here Be Monsters*: At the start of Chapter 9, Pit's declaration that they need to find Ruby after she'd fled into the Everfree Forest gets everybody talking at once. Twilight ends up using her Royal Canterlot Voice to restore order, shouting "SIT DOWN, ALL OF YOU!!!" Violet gets a non-verbal version later in the same chapter. She overhears Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie and Applejack arguing about the events of "The Mysterious Mare Do Well", rattles her tail to get their attention, and promptly reams them out for their failure to get what heroism is all about. - *Infinity Train: Knight of the Orange Lily*: Tokio is forced to confront grey versions of the Apex kids — who assaulted him years ago and culminating in a murder of a rabbit and his guilt for replacing them (long story) — and decides to tell them off in this matter.

Also in book 2, Q.C. Pendergrast lets out a big "Quiet. Immediately." at Hubert Morris and Stewart Delacorte when they start protesting James Delcorte's will, which left the house and the majority of his money to his butler rather than a family member (one of the few times the pair agree), informing them that if they turn it into a legal fight, they will lose. At the end of the book, it's left up in the air as to whether said butler actually will get his inheritance after it turns out he killed James, since Mississippi law prohibits murderers from profiting from their crimes. - At the climax of *Dune*, Paul tires of Reverend Mother Gauis Helen Mohiam's persistently-haughty behavior especially in the face of him having just humbled the Emperor of the Known Universe and bellows "Silence!" Not only does [the Voice](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick) force her to shut up, it's so powerful she is physically knocked backwards. Paul is also making a [Call-Back](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack) to Mohiam callously ordering his silence while torturing him to determine his "humanity", while demonstrating his subsequent implication that his Voice is so powerful that he can simply order her to drop dead if he wanted. - In the *Frog and Toad* story "The Dream", from *Frog And Toad Together*, Toad dreams he is on a stage where an unseen announcer announces Toad performing a variety of impressive acts. Each time, Toad performs perfectly, then asks his friend Frog, who is in the audience, if he can do the same. Each time, Frog is forced to say no, and literally shrinks as he does so. Eventually, after several repetitions, Frog has shrunk away to nothing, leaving Toad quite distraught. When the announcer attempts to extol yet another performance for Toad, Toad interrupts him with this trope before waking relieved that it was [All Just a Dream](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream). - [Isaac Asimov](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov)'s "[Galley Slave](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalleySlave)": When EZ-27 attempts to explain the reason why it changed certain passages in Professor Ninheimer's book, the man shouts that it had been ordered to [keep quiet, inadvertently revealing](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreisandEffect) that he had been responsible for the hack rewriting of his book. - From the *Harry Potter* series: Harry snaps and yells a big "SHUT UP!" to Snape after the latter maliciously taunts him about the kind of arrogant jerk his father was in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix after Harry is proven innocent in the court, Fred, George, and Ginny do a war dance to the tune of "He got off, he got off, he got off..." which makes Mrs. Weasley invoke this trope. Also in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, when the adults finally tell Harry what is going on, against Mrs Weasley's better judgment, Sirius starts to say something about a weapon; and Mrs Weasley interrupts with a loud "That's enough!", to stop him saying more. At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore asks Harry to give Kreacher an order, to test whether he has properly inherited the house-elf as Sirius intended. Due to Kreacher's incessant whining, all Harry can think of is to tell him: "Kreacher, Shut up!"

Ursule: Shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup!!]] You are so gross! Them, you, everyone! Anyone rooting for Team Horn! Clowns who lost to them and have the nerve to be here at all! Every one of you is smearing dirt on the face of Kimberly! You are impure! You are mages, yet you pretend to have friends?! Laughing and crying like humans! Love? Respect? Consideration? That is all clutter, worse than refuse! Do not bring that crap here! …Control and obedience…! If you have that…then you need nothing else! Nothing!Oliver: Is that actually what you believe? Or is it a cry for help? - *Spectral Shadows*: When the Suburbians are being quite an annoyance in regards to Sir Jon overriding Kacey's parents' decision to pull the plug on her life support.

" - *The Worst Witch*: In the first book, Mildred turns a group of twenty witches into snails.

Most of the time, though, it would be Jack hollering "Wait a minute!" at his quartet, the Sportsmen, in a [futile attempt to stop them](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalisInterruptus) from going crazy with their latest wacky song. - *The Navy Lark*: Any time Seaman "Fatso" Johnson was about to inadvertently spill the beans on CPO Pertwee's latest scheme, Pertwee would quickly silence him with a sharp and loud "BELT UP!".

**Question:**
as title says - any advice on how to learn to just shut the fuck up, or in other words how to stop oversharing.i am a very naive person and i just cannot comprehend that someone would want to do me any harm, that's why i've burned myself so many times on people that i thought cared about me but they just wanted a punching bag, someone they can mock.how do i stop sharing personal stuff, whenever anyone pays me even the slightest interest i tend to overshare a lot. i wanna stop. any advice is greatly appreciated.

Fidget toys. Here me out. I talk a lot. Speech, for me, was a fidget. My brain needed that stimulation. My rate of interrupting others, saying something g without thinking, oversharing, etc went down when I bought some tangles from tanglecreations and a couple of goo-filled stress balls. The jr. Size tangles fit perfectly in one hand and keep me occupied juuuust enough that I can focus on a conversation without having to fill the air myself. The stress balls help me with my impulse control; I use them mainly for 1:1s at work with my boss. Find a quiet, one-handed fidget that can help you focus on the conversation and busy your brain long enough to delay that impulse of sharing a crucial life detail. Also, whenever you feel that urge rise up, think of a question to ask the person you’re talking to instead. For me, I would over share in an attempt to either come off as relatable or to make the other person feel heard (ironically) but you can achieve these things by showing interest in the topic through asking for more information or clarity.

**Question:**
I have this problem where I just don’t know how to shut the fuck up once I start talking. And then the rest of my time I’m just silent. I have no middle ground. Oh and when I’m silent apparently I look very angry. Not sure why but apparently my face looks bitter af. I just want to learn to talk less and chose my words wisely. Oh and think before I speak.

**Answer:**
Talking is like a game of catch. just throw the ball back and wait for it to come back to you. Try not to steal the ball by talking over your partner since this defeats the game of catch. Don't talk to much or else this isn't catch either, its just you holding the ball. Challenge your partner with challenging catches with intriguing questions to see if they could catch it and throw the ball back or let them know where your going to throw it and see if they could catch it. In any case, be funny, serious, or challenging but always throw the ball back.

**Question:**
What is the difference between shut up and fuck off ?

**Answer:**
You can say "shut up" if you're annoyed by someone and want them to be quiet, but it can also be used sarcastically in some situations. It's a rude thing to say, so don't say it at work or to your parents."Fuck off" is basically telling someone to leave you alone because you don't want to see them again. This is an extremely rude thing to say. Don't say this to anyone. In some parts of America you may get into a fist fight if you say this to a stranger for no reason.
