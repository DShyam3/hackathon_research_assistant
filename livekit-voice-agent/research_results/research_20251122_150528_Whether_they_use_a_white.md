**Question:**
"White" vs. "a white" vs. "a white person"

**Answer:**
Racial labels are always problematic. First, it's necessary to understand that not everyone accepts the notion that there are races other than the human race. Some scientists insist that what are normally considered racial differences are merely trivial differences based on **gene pool** differences. The argument is too technical for me to make any judgments about such things. I'm no expert.Typical everyday English conversations about human differences, however, usually include all these loaded terms about race. The terms you use can offend some people. Here's a link to a Wikipedia article about the racial terminology used for the US census. *White* and *Black/African American* are the terms used for those two putative races.I don't think that saying "*He's **a {white/black/brown}***" is a good idea. People don't come in only three (or a few more, like yellow and red, perhaps) colors, but in a wide variety of shades. Plus, using the indefinite article to describe a person feels like stereotyping to me.Most of the people I talk to would say "***He's {white/black}***". Some will say "***He's {Caucasian/European American/African American}***".In college papers, it's probably better to be more formal and politically correct, so I'd use "**{European American/African American}**" for Americans. For other nationalities, however, I don't know. There are probably other PC terms to use.Some African Americans prefer to be called "**African American**", and some prefer to be called "**black**". My friends from the Caribbean (St. Kitts & Nevis and St. Vincent) call themselves "**black**".I'm sure there's a lot more to say about this, but I think I've gone on long enough.

# Why we will lowercase white

## AP style will continue to lowercase the term white in racial, ethnic and cultural senses. This decision follows our move last month to capitalize Black in such uses. We consulted with a wide group of people internally and externally around the globe and considered a variety of commentary in making these decisions.

There was clear desire and reason to capitalize Black. Most notably, people who are Black have strong historical and cultural commonalities, even if they are from different parts of the world and even if they now live in different parts of the world. That includes the shared experience of discrimination due solely to the color of one’s skin.

There is, at this time, less support for capitalizing white. White people generally do not share the same history and culture, or the experience of being discriminated against because of skin color. In addition, we are a global news organization and in much of the world there is considerable disagreement, ambiguity and confusion about whom the term includes.

We agree that white people’s skin color plays into systemic inequalities and injustices, and we want our journalism to robustly explore those problems. But capitalizing the term white, as is done by white supremacists, risks subtly conveying legitimacy to such beliefs.

Some have expressed the belief that if we don’t capitalize white, we are being inconsistent and discriminating against white people or, conversely, that we are implying that white is the default. We also recognize the argument that capitalizing the term could pull white people more fully into issues and discussions of race and equality. We will closely watch how usage and thought evolves, and will periodically review our decision.

As the AP Stylebook currently directs, we will continue to avoid the broad and imprecise term brown in racial, ethnic or cultural references. If using the term is necessary as part of a direct quotation, we will continue to use the lowercase.

For more details, see the AP Stylebook’s race-related coverage guidance, which says in part: “Consider carefully when deciding whether to identify people by race. Often, it is an irrelevant factor and drawing unnecessary attention to someone’s race or ethnicity can be interpreted as bigotry.”

The guidance also says:

Reporting and writing about issues involving race calls for thoughtful consideration, precise language, and an openness to discussions with others of diverse backgrounds about how to frame coverage or what language is most appropriate, accurate and fair.

Avoid broad generalizations and labels; race and ethnicity are one part of a person’s identity. Identifying people by race and reporting on actions that have to do with race often go beyond simple style questions, challenging journalists to think broadly about racial issues before having to make decisions on specific situations and stories.

In all coverage — not just race-related coverage — strive to accurately represent the world, or a particular community, and its diversity through the people you quote and depict in all formats. Omissions and lack of inclusion can render people invisible and cause anguish.

There has been much discussion about whether the w in White and the b in Black should be capitalized.

In the summer of 2020, after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police sparked protests around the country (and around the world), most style guides that had previously called for lowercasing Black changed their position. Hundreds of media organizations, including the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/7e36c00c5af0436abc09e051261fff1f), [The New York Times,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/05/insider/capitalized-black.html)*The Los Angeles Times,* McClatchy newspapers and NBC-owned television stations, called for capitalizing Black when referring to race. However, the style gurus were divided when it came to White. Most media organizations still lowercase White. Some noted exceptions: The Washington Post, Fox News, [D Magazine](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2020/07/a-few-words-about-racism-and-style-and-capitalizing-the-words-black-and-white/), [The Conscious Style Guide.](https://consciousstyleguide.com/capitalizing-for-equality/)

One month after announcing its decision to capitalize Black, the Associated Press asserted it would not capitalize White. “Some have expressed the belief that if we don’t capitalize white, we are being inconsistent and discriminating against white (sic) people or, conversely, that we are implying that white is the default,” John Daniszewski, vice president for standards, wrote on the venerable news organization’s blog. “We also recognize the argument that capitalizing the term could pull white people more fully into issues and discussions of race and equality. We will closely watch how usage and thought evolves, and will periodically review our decision.”

In a June 2020 statement announcing its endorsement of the capitalization of Black, the National Association of Black Journalists wrote, “NABJ also recommends that whenever a color is used to appropriately describe race then it should be capitalized, including White and Brown.”

[The Center for the Study of Social Policy](https://cssp.org/2020/03/recognizing-race-in-language-why-we-capitalize-black-and-white/?gclid=CjwKCAjwkoz7BRBPEiwAeKw3q-WWbucW49QYvq5k-mqbKlrS8AHuzeQ7GWAxcJEYhxRhB-SKfqdn8RoCUGsQAvD_BwE) also makes an impassioned case for the capitalization of White as well as Black. “We believe that it is important to call attention to White as a race as a way to understand and give voice to how Whiteness functions in our social and political institutions and our communities,” staff members Ann Thúy Nguyễn and Maya Pendleton wrote in a post on the organization’s website. “Moreover, the detachment of ‘White’ as a proper noun allows White people to sit out of conversations about race and removes accountability from White people’s and White institutions’ involvement in racism.

The [American Psychological Association Style Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/racial-ethnic-minorities) also recommends capitalizing both White and Black, but it advises against using other “colors to refer to other human groups; doing so is considered pejorative.”

**White** is the [lightest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightness) [color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color)[2] and is achromatic (having no [chroma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness)). It is the color of objects such as [snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow), [chalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalk), and [milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk), and is the opposite of [black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black). White objects fully (or almost fully) [reflect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection) and [scatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering) all the [visible wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum) of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light). White on [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television) and [computer screens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_screen) is created by a mixture of [red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red), [blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue), and [green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green) light. The color white can be given with white [pigments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment), especially [titanium dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium_dioxide).[3]

In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore white togas as symbols of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white [unicorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn) symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. It was the royal color of the kings of France as well as the flag of [monarchist France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Restoration_in_France) from 1815 to [1830](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_Revolution), and of the [monarchist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_movement) that opposed the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks) during the [Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War) (1917–1922). [Greek temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_temples) and [Roman temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_temples) were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of [neoclassical architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture), white became the most common color of new churches, capitols, and other government buildings, especially in the United States. It was also widely used in 20th century [modern architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture) as a symbol of modernity and simplicity.

According to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude.[4] White is an important color for almost all world religions. The [pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope), the head of the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church), has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice. In [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam), and in the [Shinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto) religion of Japan, it is worn by pilgrims. In Western cultures and in Japan, white is the most common color for [wedding dresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_dress), symbolizing purity and virginity. In many Asian cultures, white is also the color of mourning.[5]

## Etymology

The word *white* continues [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English) hwīt, ultimately from a [Proto-Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language) *hʷītaz also reflected in [Old High German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_High_German) (h)wîz, [Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse) hvítr, and [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_language) 𐍈𐌴𐌹𐍄𐍃 (ƕeits). The root is ultimately from [Proto-Indo-European language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language) *kʷid-, surviving also in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) *śveta* "to be white or bright"[6] and Slavonic světŭ "light".[7][8] The [Icelandic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language) word for white, hvítur, is directly derived from the [Old Norse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse) form of the word hvítr. Proto-Germanic also had the word *blankaz ("white, bright, blinding"), borrowed into [Late Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Latin) as *blancus, which provided the source for [Romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages) words for "white" (Catalan, Occitan and French blanc, Spanish blanco, Italian bianco, Galician-Portuguese branco, etc.). The antonym of white is black.

Some non-European languages have a wide variety of terms for white. The [Inuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit) language has seven different words for seven different nuances of white. [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) has specific words for bright white, the white of teeth, the white of [sandalwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandalwood), the white of the autumn moon, the white of silver, the white of cow's milk, the white of pearls, the white of a ray of sunlight, and the white of stars. Japanese has six different words, depending upon brilliance or dullness, or if the color is inert or dynamic.[9]

## History and art

### Prehistoric and ancient history

White was one of the first colors used in art. The [Lascaux Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux_Cave) in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by [paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic) artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. [Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic) artists used [calcite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcite) or [chalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalk), sometimes as a background, sometimes as a highlight, along with charcoal and red and yellow ochre in their vivid cave paintings.[10][11]

In [ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt), white was connected with the goddess [Isis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis). The priests and priestesses of Isis dressed only in white linen, and it was used to wrap [mummies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummies).[12]

In Greece and other ancient civilizations, white was often associated with mother's milk. In [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology), the chief god [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus) was nourished at the breast of the nymph Amalthea.[13]

The ancient Greeks saw the world in terms of darkness and light, so white was considered a fundamental color. According to [Pliny the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder) in his *Natural History*, [Apelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apelles) (4th century BC) and the other famous painters of ancient Greece used only four colors in their paintings; white, red, yellow and black.[14] For painting, the Greeks used the highly toxic pigment [lead white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_white), made by a long and laborious process.[15]

A plain white [toga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toga), known as a *toga virilis*, was worn for ceremonial occasions by all Roman citizens over the age of 14–18. Magistrates and certain priests wore a *toga praetexta*, with a broad purple stripe. In the time of the Emperor [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus), no Roman man was allowed to appear in the Roman forum without a toga.

The ancient Romans had two words for white; *albus*, a plain white, (the source of the word *albino*); and *candidus,* a brighter white. A man who wanted public office in Rome wore a white toga brightened with chalk, called a *toga candida*, the origin of the word *candidate*. The Latin word *candere* meant to shine, to be bright. It was the origin of the words *candle* and *candid*.[16]

In [ancient Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome), the priestesses of the goddess [Vesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesta_(mythology)) dressed in white linen robes, a white [palla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palla_(garment)) or shawl, and a white veil. They protected the sacred fire and the [penates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penates) of Rome. White symbolized their purity, loyalty, and chastity.[12]

- Prehistoric paintings in Chauvet Cave, France (30,000 to 32,000 BC) - Painting of the goddess Isis (1380–1385 BC). The priests of her cult wore white linen. - Paintings of women in white from a tomb (1448–1422 BC). - Statue of the chief Vestal Virgin, wearing a white palla and a white veil.

### Postclassical history

The early Christian church adopted the Roman symbolism of white as the color of purity, sacrifice and virtue. It became the color worn by priests during Mass, the color worn by monks of the [Cistercian Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercian_Order), and, under [Pope Pius V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_V), a former monk of the [Dominican Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order), it became the official color worn by the pope himself. Monks of the [Order of Saint Benedict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Saint_Benedict) dressed in the white or gray of natural undyed wool, but later changed to black, the color of humility and penitence.

Postclassical history art, the white lamb became the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ on behalf of mankind. John the Baptist described [Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ) as the [lamb of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_of_God), who took the sins of the world upon himself. The white lamb was the center of one of the most famous paintings of the Medieval period, the *Ghent Altarpiece* by [Jan van Eyck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_van_Eyck).[17]

White was also the symbolic color of the [transfiguration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfiguration_of_Jesus). The [Gospel of Saint Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Saint_Mark) describes Jesus' clothing in this event as "shining, exceeding white as snow." Artists such as Fra Angelico used their skill to capture the whiteness of his garments. In his painting of the transfiguration at the Convent of Saint Mark in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence), Fra Angelico emphasized the white garment by using a light [gold background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_ground), placed in an almond-shaped halo.[18]

The white [unicorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn) was a common subject of Postclassical history manuscripts, paintings and tapestries. It was a symbol of purity, chastity and grace, which could only be captured by a virgin. It was often portrayed in the lap of the Virgin Mary.[19]

During the Postclassical history, painters rarely ever mixed colors; but in the Renaissance, the influential humanist and scholar [Leon Battista Alberti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Battista_Alberti) encouraged artists to add white to their colors to make them lighter, brighter, and to add *hilaritas*, or gaiety. Many painters followed his advice, and the palette of the Renaissance was considerably brighter.[20]

### Modern history

Until the 16th century, white was commonly worn by widows as a color of mourning. The widows of the kings of France wore white until [Anne of Brittany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Brittany) in the 16th century. A white tunic was also worn by many knights, along with a red cloak, which showed the knights were willing to give their blood for the king or Church.

- The monks of the order of Saint Benedict (c. 480–542) first dressed in undyed white or gray wool robes, here shown in painting by Sodoma on the life of Saint Benedict (1504). They later changed to black robes, the color of humility and penitence. - Under Pope Pius V (1504–1572), a former monk of the Dominican Order, white became the official color worn by the Pope. - The white lamb in the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck. (1432) - The Transfiguration by Fra Angelico (1440–1442) - Mary Stuart wore white in mourning for her husband, King Francis II of France, who died in 1560.

#### 18th and 19th centuries

White was the dominant color of architectural interiors in the [Baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque) period and especially the [Rococo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo) style that followed it in the 18th century. Church interiors were designed to show the power, glory and wealth of the church. They seemed to be alive, filled with curves, asymmetry, mirrors, gilding, statuary and reliefs, unified by white.

White was also a fashionable color for both men and women in the 18th century. Men in the aristocracy and upper classes wore powdered white wigs and white [stockings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockings), and women wore elaborate embroidered white and pastel gowns.

After the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution), a more austere white (*blanc cassé*) became the most fashionable color in women's costumes which were modeled after the outfits of Ancient Greece and Republican Rome. Because of the rather revealing design of these dresses, the women wearing them were called *les merveilleuses* (the marvellous) by French men of that era.[21] The [Empire style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_style) under Emperor Napoléon I was modeled after the more conservative outfits of Ancient Imperial Rome. The dresses were high in fashion but low in warmth considering the more severe weather conditions of northern France; in 1814 the former wife of Napoleon, [Joséphine de Beauharnais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9phine_de_Beauharnais), caught [pneumonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia) and died after taking a walk in the cold night air with Tsar [Alexander I of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Russia).[22]

White was the universal color of both men and women's underwear and of sheets in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was unthinkable to have sheets or underwear of any other color. The reason was simple; the manner of washing linen in boiling water caused colors to fade. When linen was worn out, it was collected and turned into high-quality paper.[23]

The 19th-century American painter [James McNeill Whistler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McNeill_Whistler) (1834–1903), working at the same time as the French impressionists, created a series of paintings with musical titles where he used color to create moods, the way composers used music. His painting *Symphony in White No. 1 – The White Girl*, which used his mistress Joanna Hiffernan as a model, used delicate colors to portray innocence and fragility, and a moment of uncertainty.[24]

- A highly theatrical white Rococo interior from the 18th century, at the Basilica at Ottobeuren, in Bavaria. - White gown of Marie Antoinette, painted by Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun in 1783. - President George Washington in a white powdered wig. The first five Presidents of the United States wore dark suits with powdered wigs for formal occasions. - Portrait of Joséphine de Beauharnais in a classic Empire gown, modeled after the clothing of ancient Rome. (1801), by François Gérard. (The State Hermitage Museum). - Empress Maria Leopoldina of Brazil wearing a white gown and a white pearls necklace, by Luís Schlappriz - Symphony in White No. 1 – The White Girl, by James McNeill Whistler (1862). - Queen Natalie of Serbia (1890)

#### 20th and 21st centuries

The [White movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_movement) was the opposition that formed against the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks) during the [Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War), which followed the [Russian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution) in 1917. It was finally defeated by the Bolsheviks in 1921–22, and many of its members emigrated to Europe.

At the end of the 19th century, lead white was still the most popular pigment; but between 1916 and 1918, chemical companies in [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway) and the United States began to produce [titanium white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium_white), made from [titanium oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium_oxide). It had first been identified in the 18th century by the German chemist [Martin Klaproth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Klaproth), who also discovered [uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium). It had twice the covering power of lead white, and was the brightest white pigment known. By 1945, 80 percent of the white pigments sold were titanium white.[25]

The absoluteness of white appealed to modernist painters. It was used in its simplest form by the Russian suprematist painter [Kazimir Malevich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimir_Malevich) in his 1917 painting 'the white square,' the companion to his earlier 'black square.' It was also used by the Dutch modernist painter [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian). His most famous paintings consisted of a pure white canvas with grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of primary colors.

Black and white also appealed to modernist architects, such as [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier) (1887–1965). He said a house was "a machine for living in" and called for a "calm and powerful architecture" built of reinforced concrete and steel, without any ornament or frills.[26] Almost all the buildings of contemporary architect [Richard Meier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Meier), such as his museum in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome) to house the ancient Roman [Ara Pacis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_Pacis), or Altar of Peace, are stark white, in the tradition of Le Corbusier.

- Poster for the White Army during the Russian Civil War (1917–22). The poster says: "for a United Russia." - The Villa Savoye (1928–31) by Le Corbusier; Le Corbusier called for a "calm and powerful" architecture built of steel and reinforced concrete, without color or ornament.

## Scientific understanding (color science)

Light is perceived by the human visual system as white when the incoming light to the eye stimulates all three types of color sensitive [cone cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell) in the eye in roughly equal amounts.[27] Materials that do not emit light themselves appear white if their surfaces reflect back most of the light that strikes them in a [diffuse way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection).

### White light

"White light" redirects here. For other uses, see [White light (disambiguation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_light_(disambiguation)).

- In the RGB color model, used to create colors on TV and computer screens, white is made by mixing red, blue and green light at full intensity. - White light refracted in a prism revealing the color components.

In 1666, [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) demonstrated that [white light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum#Visible_radiation_(light)) was composed of multiple colors by passing it through a [prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism_(optics)) to break it up into components then using a second prism to reassemble them. Before Newton, most scientists believed that white was the fundamental color of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light).[28]

White light can be generated by the sun, by stars, or by earthbound sources such as [fluorescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamp) lamps, [white LEDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode#White) and [incandescent bulbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_lamps). On the screen of a color television or computer, white is produced by mixing the [primary colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_color) of light: red, green and blue ([RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB)) at full intensity, a process called [additive mixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_mixing) (see image above). White light can be fabricated using light with only two wavelengths, for instance by mixing light from a red and cyan laser or yellow and blue lasers. This light will however have very few practical applications since color rendering of objects will be greatly distorted.

The fact that light sources with vastly different [spectral power distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_power_distribution) can result in a similar sensory experience is due to the way the light is processed by the visual system. One color that arises from two different spectral power distributions is called a [metamerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)).

Many of the light sources that emit white light emit light at almost all visible wavelengths (sun light, incandescent lamps of various [Color temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature)). This has led to the notion that white light can be defined as a mixture of "all colors" or "all visible wavelengths".[29][30]

A range of spectral distributions of light sources can be perceived as white—there is no single, unique specification of "white light". For example, when buying a "white" light bulb, one might buy one labeled 2700K, 6000K, etc., which produce light having very different spectral distributions, and yet this will not prevent the user from identifying the color of objects that those light bulbs illuminate.[31]

### White objects

Color vision allows us to distinguish different [objects by their color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color#Color_of_objects). In order to do so, [color constancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy) can keep the perceived color of an object relatively unchanged when the illumination changes among various broad (whitish) spectral distributions of light.[31]

The same principle is used in photography and cinematography where the choice of [white point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_point) determines a transformation of all other color stimuli. Changes in or manipulation of the white point can be used to explain some optical illusions such as [The dress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress_(viral_phenomenon)).

While there is no single, unique specification of "white light", there is indeed a unique specification of "white object", or, more specifically, "white surface". A perfectly white surface [diffusely reflects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection) ([scatters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_scattering)) all visible light that strikes it, without [absorbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_absorption) any, irrespective of the light's wavelength or spectral distribution.[32][33] Since it does not absorb any of the incident light, white is the lightest possible color. If the reflection is not diffuse but rather [specular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection), this describes a mirror rather than a white surface.[34][32]

Reflection of 100% of incident light at all wavelengths is a form of uniform reflectance, so white is an achromatic color, meaning a color without [chroma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness#Chroma).[35][36] The color stimulus produced by the perfect diffuser is usually considered to be an achromatic stimulus for all illuminants, except for those whose light sources appear to be highly chromatic.[37]

Color constancy is achieved by [chromatic adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_adaptation). The [International Commission on Illumination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Illumination) defines *white (adapted)* as "a color stimulus that an observer who is [chromatically] adapted to the viewing environment would judge to be perfectly achromatic and to have a luminance factor of unity. The color stimulus that is considered to be the adapted white may be different at different locations within a scene.[38]

### White features in nature

- Snow is composed of ice and air; it scatters or reflects sunlight without absorbing other colors of the spectrum. - Cumulus clouds look white because the water droplets reflect and scatter the sunlight without absorbing other colors.

**Content:**
Plain and clean, the color white makes a bold statement.

When every wavelength is reflected from a surface, our eyes see the color white. On the other hand, we perceive the color black when a negligible amount of light is reflected.

White conjures images of purity, orderliness, and innocence, and it might make a room seem more spacious. But white spaces can also seem stark, sterile, bland, and empty. White may seem icy and cold as well.

We may associate white with ‘clean slates’, which is why the color is also often linked to ‘new beginnings’ or ‘fresh starts’.

Since it has no hue, and some people don’t even consider it a color, you might wonder how white is created. What colors make white?

## The Quick Version

White occurs when all light wavelengths reflect. In additive color, red, green, and blue light combine to make white. Subtractive mixing with paints, whether under an RGB or CMY model, cannot create white. White is achromatic, which means without color.

To make white paint, use white pigments (such as calcium carbonate, zinc oxide, lead carbonate, calcium hydroxide). Tint white to get off-white shades.

## Understanding Mixing Colors

There are two ways you can mix colors.

The first is additive mixing, which is the process of combining two or more different hues of light. This is most commonly used for digital displays: computer screens, TVs, mobile devices, and so on.

Since every color of light adds to the previous ones, the resulting color can be brighter. Adding all the primary colors of light (red, green, and blue) together creates white.

Then, there is subtractive mixing, which is the type that most people are familiar with. This technique involves blending colored substances like paints or inks to produce a different hue. This method can’t create white.

## Achromatic Colors

Sometimes, people think of black and white as being outside the spectrum of colors. These colors do not exist the same way as others do since they are often a type of shading that changes the brightness or darkness of another color.

For this reason, black and white are known as achromatic colors. They are only a shade; they do not possess any hue or saturation.

Gray is another achromatic color, in between black and white.

Overall, while creating white, it is important to recognize that it has a few inherent limitations that make it hard for artists to produce the color from scratch.

## What Colors Make White?

When blue, green, and red light are added together, the result is white light. But no mix of other hues will result in white paint. Instead, mixing all the primary colors – whether under the RYB model (red, yellow, and blue) or the CMY model (cyan, magenta, and yellow) – will create a muddy brown or black. This means that for white paint or ink, you need a white pigment in the first place.

Since white denotes the lack of color, the more colors you mix in, the farther you are from obtaining white.

Instead, you’ll begin producing deeper tones until you end up with the color black.

Unfortunately, there is no method to combine two colors to get white, regardless of what you do. You would need to remove the entire saturation of the hue. It’s best to use pre-created white substances (paints, for example).

One fun way to create an illusion of white from colored paint is to make a simple rainbow disc spinner, where the colors combine to make white. This is because the eye is perceiving all the colors as light simultaneously.

## How Do You Make White Paint?

You might be wondering how white paint is made in the first place! The answer lies in the use of white pigment. A white pigment is combined with a medium, such as alkyd resin or acrylic, to make white paint. Typically, calcium hydroxide, mineral powders, zinc oxide, lead carbonate, and calcium carbonate are used as pigments by paint makers.

The process of producing white paint demands precise chemistry, so this probably isn’t one to try at home. Some substances used to create white pigments can be harmful.

## Mixing Various Off-White Colors

Although making white paint may not be an option, many artists will produce various off-white options using different colors. This is because any kind of white paint can have various accents and hints added to it.

Here is how you can create the most popular ‘almost white’ hues:

## Common Off-White Hex Colors

| Name | Hex Code | RGB Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light Honey | #ECE3CF | rgb(236, 227, 207) |
| Eggshell | #F0EAD6 | rgb(240, 234, 214) |
| Ivory | #FFFFF0 | rgb(255, 255, 240) |
| Beige | #F5F5DC | rgb(245, 245, 220) |
| Off White | #FAF9F6 | rgb(250, 249, 246) |
| Pale Almond | #E8D8C1 | rgb(232, 216, 193) |

To keep the colors you are using from making your white too saturated, there are a few best practices you can stick to. First off, rather than add white to the other colors, add those colors to the white.

Secondly, always begin by dabbing a small amount … probably less than what you feel you need for your desired shade. Pure white will quickly change in the presence of dominant hues like black and brown.

The nice thing about using white is that it is very forgiving – if you go too far with the color you’re adding, simply put more white into the mix.

## White in Design

The color white is often used as a negative space, for a plain wall, blank sheet of paper, or white space around text.

White is typically seen as being clean and pure. As a canvas, white is seen as unblemished, calming, and welcoming. You can use white much more skillfully in your designs if you know how it impacts our perceptions and our senses.

Additionally, white is far more brilliant than other hues. It can come across as a brilliant light in a design since even colors like yellow or brilliant green look dull when compared to pure white.

Be cautious, though: if a region of your work is entirely white, people might assume that the design is missing something or that that particular area is blank.

For this reason, it is essential that you design it in a way that makes it obvious that it belongs there.

Overall, if you know how to use it properly, white is a great method to add shine and luster to a project.

## Using White in Interior Design

In interior design, white not only serves as a great foundation for distinctive elements, but it also suggests openness and calm.

As mentioned, there are numerous shades of off-white, which is why the color is far from a boring choice. White is often associated with minimalism, but you don’t have to be a minimalist to appreciate its style. Here is how you can use this timeless achromatic color when designing or renovating your home:

### Creating an Illusion of Space

The properties of white allow it to reflect all wavelengths of visible light. This helps make spaces bigger and more open. White is often used as a neutral wall color, and when used on floors and furniture, it can make a room look bigger. Also, white can open up small spaces like hallways and nooks, as well as spaces above windows and door frames, by reflecting more natural light.

### Making a Chic Appearance

A second benefit of white is that it can be used as a base for flexibility. Because it is neutral, it doesn’t clash with things like hidden storage spaces, extendable lamps, and foldaway desks. Instead, white gives any room a stylish look, no matter how big or small it is. When you combine warm white shades with soft lighting, the result is a welcoming, roomy ambience.

You can also use LED lighting to make the white color stand out in your interior. Try putting the lights under your stairs to create a kind of glowing appearance.

### Establishing a Purpose

White can emphasize the meaning or purpose of a room. For example, since white represents purity and cleanliness, it often makes sense for bathrooms. On a practical level, white bathroom fixtures can be bleached clean, whereas colored fixtures might be discolored by bleach.

In other rooms, like the living room or kitchen, white elements can make a space look more modern. Mix white with other netural tones like a black TV mounted on the wall and silver lamps for a sleeker appearance. Hanging prints and photos in white frames on the wall is also trendy right now.

White with pastel colors is a fun way to liven up a child’s room or a creative space like an office. You can also go for a white wall with accent colors to create a striking look.

## Experimenting

When designing with white, texture is essential. Mixing different shapes, like oval tables with cube shelves and straight furniture, is a simple way to add layers. A large white lampshade is another great finishing touch because it creates depth and establishes a central point of interest.

If you’re worried about having too much white in your home, go for wooden floors. Wood’s earthy tones go well with white and make things feel more natural. Marble is also a good match because it is slightly white and goes well with a white color scheme. Marble is great for kitchen countertops or you could even try a wall with a marble pattern.

Note that white can often appear as blue or orange due to different light sources in the real world. For example, you may have slightly blue light coming from a light bulb, making a white shade appear blue. The same goes for a white piece of paper on a sunny day. The colors of light can affect how white is perceived.

### Home Gallery

There’s a reason why most walls in art galleries are white: it keeps the attention on the art.

You can also do this if you want one piece or a group of pieces to take over a room. Add splashes of color that aren’t as eye-catching to make the room feel cosy enough for everyday life.

## FAQs

### What colors of light make white?

Red, green, and blue light mixed at equal, bright levels create white. This is called additive mixing.

### Why do phone and TV screens use RGB for white?

Screens emit light. They blend red, green, and blue pixels at full power to make white, often shown as RGB 255, 255, 255 or hex #FFFFFF.

### Can I mix paints to make white?

No. Paints work by subtractive mixing. Mixing colors absorbs more light, so you get grays or browns, not white. White paint is a pigment, usually titanium dioxide.

### What about printing, do CMY inks make white?

No. Printers make white by leaving paper unprinted. Combining cyan, magenta, and yellow absorbs most light, which creates a dark brown, dark gray, or black, not white.

### Can spinning a color wheel make white?

Yes. Fast spinning blends colors in your vision. This is additive in effect, so balanced segments can appear nearly white under strong light.

### Why does white look different under different bulbs?

Color temperature and spectrum vary. Warm bulbs shift white toward yellow or red, cool bulbs shift it toward blue. CRI also affects how neutral white appears.

## Wrapping Up

Subtractive mixing can be used to create any color on the spectrum … but that doesn’t include white. White is not the presence but the absence of color.

That said, there is no doubt that white has a dramatic subtlety to it – something that makes it an immensely fun color to play around with. Once you know how to mix white with other colors to make different off-whites, you can make more realistic depth, texture, and shadows.

# The Difference Between White and Off-White Wall Colors: A Comprehensive Guide

IntroductionChoosing a good color for the wall is an acute test. For all of them, white and off-white have long been the mainstay of the choices for homeowners, designers, and decorators. And just because they have similar sounding names do not mean that white and off-white are interchangeable. Even the slightest differences in shades can make a great difference to a room’s atmosphere, mood, and aesthetic look.

From white to off-white, this piece explores how white and off-white wall colors can be compared under multiple headings, including their psychological effects, moods, interaction with light, decor, and styles as well as influence and further affect the perceived space and cleanliness, energy consumption, and work with different architectural styles. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a much better understanding of which shade is right for your home or design project.

1. White and Off-White1.1 Definition of WhiteThe lightest color, the purest form of white is considered an absence of color. The reflection of all wavelengths of visible light defines the color. White is strongly linked with modernity, cleanliness, and minimalism for pure white giving a space a crunchy sharp and clean look which makes it look expansive and bright.

Some of the properties of pure white include:

Strong reflectivity of light.Neutralizing.It is a blank canvas, so any furniture and other design elements take the real limelight.Some most popular pure white varieties used in interior designing are :Chantilly Lace by Benjamin Moore: Stark crisp whiteSimply White by Benjamin Moore: Warm yet neutral enough to maintain cleanliness and freshness.Ultra Pure White by Behr: As close as “blank” you can get to white. 1.2 Defining Off-WhiteOff-white encompasses all kinds of hues but whatever is off-white remains always with the lightness and airy character of white. It will frequently have a faint hint or undertone: beige, cream, ivory, or gray. The occurrence of such undertones diminishes the stiffness of pure white and can add warmth or richness to a room.

Of the qualities of off-white include some of the following:

Not as reflective as pure white.Capability of creating a cozier, inviting atmosphere.Undertone being warm or cool, could easily change the feel for any room.Some of the best known varieties of off-white are:White Dove by Benjamin Moore: A warm off white with soft creamy undertoneAlabaster by Sherwin Williams: A balanced off white neutral with warmth and coolnessSwiss Coffee by Behr: A warm off-white with an accent of beige, also versatile 2. Visual and Psychologic Impact2.1 The Psychology of WhiteOne can associate white with serenity, calmness, and openness. In pure white, walls act more like a backdrop while promoting clarity of mind and cutting on distraction. These factors contribute to why white is used prominently in minimalist and modern design schemes.

However, white produces sparseness if it has not been balanced by other components. White feels cold or stark if it is alone in the aspects.White Overwhelming big rooms or rooms with severe lighting

White can be symbolic of, depending on the occasion:Clarity: This is because it removes or eliminates visual clutter, and a person’s attention remains on the framework or furniture in that room.Modernism: Pure white walls are said to represent modern contemporary design.Sterility: Pure white, especially in medical institution, is too sterile and not warm.2.2 Psychology of Off-WhiteOff-white tones have the neutral aspect of white added with softness and warmth qualities. These make off-white more versatile and commodious in creating inviting, homely atmospheres. The undertones may be either warm, making it a cozier room, or cool, giving it a more contemporary feel.

Psychological Effects of Off-whiteComfort and Warmth-Off-white shades such as ivory, cream, or beige can make a place feel welcome.Versatility: Off-white has undertones, which easily fit into several different moods, such as cozy and warm, elegant and formal, etc.Soft Depth: Unlike pure white, off-white contains layers of depth that can visually be very interesting without overwhelming the senses.3. Interaction with Light3.1 White and LightingThe lighting also plays a factor in how the color of the white wall will look. Especially for whites, this can be really true. A white wall is a reflective surface, and the appearance changes greatly with lighting in the room.

Natural Light: White walls tend to look great in rooms which get enough natural light, as they are reflective and make a room bright and airy. But in north facing rooms where the light might be cooler, white walls can end up having more of a cold bluish tinge to them.Artificial Light: When to be lit by cool-toned LEDs, pure white can feel harsh or clinical. There, sometimes one must couple white with warm lighting in order to balance out the coolness of the white.3.2 Off-White and LightingOff-white walls are not as reflective as pure white, and thus they engage light differently. They do not send the light bouncing around so much, and this can tend to soften and diffuse the ambiance.

Off-white shades don’t lose their warmth and softness as easily under natural light. Consequently, this color shade is quite suitable for rooms receiving massive sunlight. Beige or yellow undertones warm the interior in a room with cooler light entering the space, thus warming up the interior.Artificial Light: The off-whites are actually more tolerant of artificial light because their undertones do not make them seem too sharp or starchy. They have a warm and cozy feel, especially with warm, yellow-toned lights.4. Sense of Space: White vs. Off-White4.1 White for Expanded FeelOne of the most famous attributes of pure white is that it helps in creating an illusion of more space and openness. This is because light reflects the most off the walls which are colored white, giving that impression of a room occupying much space. Pure white, therefore, makes for a pretty good choice for small rooms, low ceilings, or those with light that barely filters in.

White is used in design:

Small rooms: White walls can lend an airy feel even to cramped quarters.Corridors and narrower spaces: White walls at least neutralize the claustrophobic effect of often-neglected areas.High room: White highlights height and extent, thereby drawing attention to architectural features such as beams or skylights.4.2 Off-White for Cozy AmbianceWhile the off-whites can be quite overpowering to achieve airy and light finishes, they retain an element that cannot be achieved with pure white: soft coziness. Subtle depth in off-whites under tones prevents the space from becoming too vast or clinical works well within the living rooms, bedrooms, and dining areas that prioritize comfort.

Off-white design advantages include:

Functionality, enough air: Off-white will always create in the room a light airy impression and never make it seem sparse or hostile.Giving a less spacious atmosphere: In spacious rooms, off-white can suppress the feeling of the space and add a feeling of warmth and depth to the room.Decorating ability flexibility: The slight differences in the shade of off-white can complement both traditional and modern interior design.5. Combination Style and Decoration5.1 White with Various Design StylesWhite walls can be a multi-purpose background for most interior styles. Pure white, on the other hand, is mostly people’s favorite tone in modern designs, minimalist, and Scandinavian designs. However, the very simplicity in either lines or spaces will give a central message in such designs.

Minimalist Design: With white walls, furniture pieces and accessories become centers without other things distracting them. Architectural details will also be emphasized by the white walls.Scandinavian Design: White is an element of Scandinavian style, where it’s often used with natural wood tones, light fabrics, and plain, functional furniture to create a bright, welcoming space.Modern and Contemporary Spaces: Pure white should be used for modern interior designs which strike a chord within open space and sharp, angular furniture and designs.5.2 Off-White with Different Design StylesOff-white is warm and very versatile for a variety of design styles. Whether it is an inside decoration of a traditional, rustic, or eclective space, off-white walls tend to provide a neutral background where other design elements in the room can shine.

Off-white walls with warm undertones can easily work well with a classic interior, combined with rich wooden furniture, vintage pieces, or any ornate detail.Country and Farm House Interior Design: Off-white combines wonderfully in the country-style design, especially with the earthy tone aspect drawing focus on natural texture.Eclectic Interiors: With a few styles combined under one roof, off-white colour indeed proves to be an excellent choice for eclectic designs, where rich patterns, colors, and textures blend to create something apparent yet visually attractive.6. The Role of Undertones6.1 White UndertonesFor example, while we automatically think of white as being neutral, different whites can have subtle undertones that affect the way they appear under different lighting or when they are viewed over another color.

Cool undertones: White with a hint of blue or gray can be sleek and modern-looking, but it can also be too cold or not welcoming in rooms with less natural light.Warm undertones: White colors that have a yellow or beige undertone give an impression of warmth and are used for cozy, lived-in settings.6.2 Off-White UndertonesOff-white’s most distinguishing feature is their undertones which might be warm or cool. The undertone you can choose drastically changes how a room will look and feel.

Warm off-whites: If an off-white contains yellowish or reddish undertones, the off-white can exhibit a warm undertone, almost resembling cream or ivory. Perfect for the creation of a warm and welcoming area of space, they also coordinate very well with warm wood tones, gold accents, and other earthy tones.Cool whites: Off-whites with gray, blue, or green undertones bring crisp freshness to a room without the starkness of pure white. They are particularly suited to modern or contemporary spaces, especially those with high concentrations of metal and glass.7. Maintenance and Practicality7.1 White Walls: Practical ConsiderationsSuch white walls can look beautiful but are not very maintainable, especially in households with a lot of traffic or children and pets. Pure white colors show dirt, smudges, and imperfections more readily than other shades. Therefore, they may need to be cleaned more often or possibly touched up.

Still, there are practical advantages to white walls:

White walls are simple to retouch: Painting over a white wall is easy since it does not have the hassle of extensive primer and base coats.Eternal : White is never going to go out of fashion; therefore, choosing white walls is a long-term decision on design.7.2 Off-White WallsOff-white is a more forgiving wall color in terms of dirt, marks, and imperfections because the undertones give it a slight colour variation and break up flaws, thus making it a more practical choice for houses with high traffic or with families.Off-white has the following advantages:

Off-white walls scuff, smudge, or dust less noticeably than purely white walls.Timeless look: Off-white, much like its pure white sibling, is a classic color that transitions nicely to changing decor styles.8. Energy Efficiency and Environmental Impact8.1 White Walls and Energy EfficiencyAnother not-so-well-talked-about advantage of wall color is its contribution to energy efficiency. Since white walls reflect light much better than darker colors, they would contribute to a reduction of artificial lighting requirements in most days of the year as long as the rooms permit optimal utilization of natural light. With time, this can translate into a saving on energy, especially in homes or offices where the money invested in electricity for lighting is considerable.

8.2 Off-White Walls and Energy EfficiencyOff-white walls are only minimally less reflective than pure white walls but still reflect enough light to minimize the need for artificial lighting in well-lit rooms. Off-white tones are also just marginally warmer, which may make for a more comfortable climate, and thus reduce the demand to overheat in colder climates.

9. White vs. Off-White in Various Architectural Styles9.1 Modern and Contemporary ArchitectureModern and contemporary architecture often uses clean lines, open spaces, and simplicity. As such, white is one of the hottest colors used in modern homes, which accentuates architectural characteristics and works well with minimal decorations.

9.2 Traditional and Historic HomesOff-white is typically safe in older or historic homes because soft, muted tones add to the character of older buildings without overpowering moldings, wainscoting, or woodwork.

ConclusionIt is not just based on the color preference, but something that makes a difference in the atmosphere, perception of space, and feeling of a space. White offers that crisp, modern, expansive feel, which suites minimalist and contemporary spaces. Off-white gives that warm, rich look and can be versatile enough to go with cozy, traditional, and eclectic spaces.

The difference between white and off-white requires considering the particular needs of your space: size, lighting, and function, as well as personal style preferences. Both colors find their perfect places in interior design, so with careful consideration, you will be choosing the perfect shade to enhance the beauty and functionality of your home.

**Title:** meaning - a white color/the color white - English Language Learners Stack Exchange

**Question:**
a white color/the color white

**Answer:**
Language is not always consistent and it isn't always exact. This being said, it is at the very least commendable to strive for exactness. This is perhaps the gist of many of the comments here.> When you see a red colour ...If you want to express seeing a *traffic light*, you probably should say "when you see a red (traffic) light". But maybe you want to say "if you see anything red": a traffic light, but also a "don't enter"-sign (no 267) a red line on the floor or whatever, then stop walking. In this case "if you see *something* red" would be better.Of course "a red colour" does exist, but then "colour" is a synonym for "shade". "Mauve", "russet", "carmine" and "blood-red" are all "red colours". But this is perhaps not the meaning you intended.> 2 I want the room to be the color white.
> 2a I want the room to be a white color.Again, language is neither consistent nor exact. If you *want the room to be white* you probably mean you want the *walls* to be white, maybe the furniture too. In 2a "colour" again means "shade". What exactly the - grammatical - difference between "off-white" and "white" is, so that of these two> I want the room to be an off-white colourand> I want the room to be a white colourone were to be correct and the other weren't eludes me. Of course, "white is white" (which is, btw., not the *absence of colour* - that would be black - but the *presence of all colours*), but then "red is red" and we have established above that there are several variations on that one. The same is true for white. The RAL-catalogue for instance, lists RAL9001, RAL9002, RAL9010, RAL9012, RAL9016 and RAL9018 all under "weiß".Then, on the other hand, there is some leeway in expression: "to be pedantic", when one says "I want to watch a movie" it is implied that one doesn't only want to *watch* but also to *listen* (silent films today are the very rare exceptions) to it. Would we correct him? Probably not.In general (philosophical rant ON): language is a device to transmit meaning. As long as this is done with a sufficient success-rate you are doing right. By making your language more clear, more concise and more exact (in other words: the better you speak/write a language) you will increase this rate of success and therefore you should undergo every possible effort to do so. On the other hand, there is leeway and as long as you are "sufficiently successful" in transporting the intended meaning you are doing OK. (philosohpical rant OFF)

**Question:**
When you mix all colors of light together, you get white. So, if combining all colors gives you white, wouldn't that make white the ultimate color? Yet I keep hearing people say it's not a color at all. What am I misunderstanding about how color works?

**Answer:**
Additive vs subtractive colors. If you're talking about light (additive) then white is the presence of all colors, and black is the lack of color/light. If you're talking about paint or ink (subtractive) then it's the opposite; if you mix all the colors you get black (or brown ish) and the default lack of color is white. That's also why RGB are the base colors of light, whereas cyan, yellow and magenta are the base colors of ink. TLDR color is weird.
