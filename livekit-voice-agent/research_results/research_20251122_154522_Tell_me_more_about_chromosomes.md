**Summary:** Chromosomes are thread-like structures found within the nucleus of animal and plant cells, composed of DNA tightly coiled around proteins called histones. They play a crucial role in carrying genomic information, with humans possessing 23 pairs of chromosomes that collectively contain approximately 21,000 genes distributed along 3 billion base pairs of DNA. These chromosomes are essential for cellular functions, genetic inheritance, and the overall maintenance of an organism's genetic identity. Importantly, chromosomes are typically not visible in the cell’s nucleus until the cell undergoes division.

# Chromosomes Fact Sheet

Chromosomes are thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells.

## What is a chromosome?

Chromosomes are thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells. Each chromosome is made of protein and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Passed from parents to offspring, DNA contains the specific instructions that make each type of living creature unique.

The term chromosome comes from the Greek words for color (chroma) and body (soma). Scientists gave this name to chromosomes because they are cell structures, or bodies, that are strongly stained by some colorful dyes used in research.

## What do chromosomes do?

The unique structure of chromosomes keeps DNA tightly wrapped around spool-like proteins, called histones. Without such packaging, DNA molecules would be too long to fit inside cells. For example, if all of the DNA molecules in a single human cell were unwound from their histones and placed end-to-end, they would stretch 6 feet.

For an organism to grow and function properly, cells must constantly divide to produce new cells to replace old, worn-out cells. During cell division, it is essential that DNA remains intact and evenly distributed among cells. Chromosomes are a key part of the process that ensures DNA is accurately copied and distributed in the vast majority of cell divisions. Still, mistakes do occur on rare occasions.

Changes in the number or structure of chromosomes in new cells may lead to serious problems. For example, in humans, one type of leukemia and some other cancers are caused by defective chromosomes made up of joined pieces of broken chromosomes.

It is also crucial that reproductive cells, such as eggs and sperm, contain the right number of chromosomes and that those chromosomes have the correct structure. If not, the resulting offspring may fail to develop properly. For example, people with Down syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21, instead of the two copies found in other people.

## Do all living things have the same types of chromosomes?

Chromosomes vary in number and shape among living things. Most bacteria have one or two circular chromosomes. Humans, along with other animals and plants, have linear chromosomes that are arranged in pairs within the nucleus of the cell.

The only human cells that do not contain pairs of chromosomes are reproductive cells, or gametes, which carry just one copy of each chromosome. When two reproductive cells unite, they become a single cell that contains two copies of each chromosome. This cell then divides and its successors divide numerous times, eventually producing a mature individual with a full set of paired chromosomes in virtually all of its cells.

Besides the linear chromosomes found in the nucleus, the cells of humans and other complex organisms carry a much smaller type of chromosome similar to those seen in bacteria. This circular chromosome is found in mitochondria, which are structures located outside the nucleus that serve as the cell's powerhouses.

Scientists think that, in the past, mitochondria were free-living bacteria with the ability to convert oxygen into energy. When these bacteria invaded cells lacking the power to tap into oxygen's power, the cells retained them, and, over time, the bacteria evolved into modern-day mitochondria.

## What are centromeres?

The constricted region of linear chromosomes is known as the centromere. Although this constriction is called the centromere, it usually is not located exactly in the center of the chromosome and, in some cases, is located almost at the chromosome's end. The regions on either side of the centromere are referred to as the chromosome's arms.

Centromeres help to keep chromosomes properly aligned during the complex process of cell division. As chromosomes are copied in preparation for production of a new cell, the centromere serves as an attachment site for the two halves of each replicated chromosome, known as sister chromatids.

## What are telomeres?

Telomeres are repetitive stretches of DNA located at the ends of linear chromosomes. They protect the ends of chromosomes in a manner similar to the way the tips of shoelaces keep them from unraveling.

In many types of cells, telomeres lose a bit of their DNA every time a cell divides. Eventually, when all of the telomere DNA is gone, the cell cannot replicate and dies.

White blood cells and other cell types with the capacity to divide very frequently have a special enzyme that prevents their chromosomes from losing their telomeres. Because they retain their telomeres, such cells generally live longer than other cells.

Telomeres also play a role in cancer. The chromosomes of malignant cells usually do not lose their telomeres, helping to fuel the uncontrolled growth that makes cancer so devastating.

## How many chromosomes do humans have?

Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes.

In fact, each species of plants and animals has a set number of chromosomes. A fruit fly, for example, has four pairs of chromosomes, while a rice plant has 12 and a dog, 39.

## How are chromosomes inherited?

In humans and most other complex organisms, one copy of each chromosome is inherited from the female parent and the other from the male parent. This explains why children inherit some of their traits from their mother and others from their father.

The pattern of inheritance is different for the small circular chromosome found in mitochondria. Only egg cells - and not sperm cells - keep their mitochondria during fertilization. So, mitochondrial DNA is always inherited from the female parent. In humans, a few conditions, including some forms of hearing impairment and diabetes, have been associated with DNA found in the mitochondria.

## Do males have different chromosomes than females?

Yes, they differ in a pair of chromosomes known as the sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes in their cells, while males have one X and one Y chromosome.

Inheriting too many or not enough copies of sex chromosomes can lead to serious problems. For example, females who have extra copies of the X chromosome are usually taller than average and some have mental disability. Males with more than one X chromosome have Klinefelter syndrome, which is a condition characterized by tall stature and, often, impaired fertility. Another syndrome caused by imbalance in the number of sex chromosomes is Turner syndrome. Women with Turner have one X chromosome only. They are very short, usually do not undergo puberty and some may have kidney or heart problems.

## How were chromosomes discovered?

Scientists looking at cells under the microscope first observed chromosomes in the late 1800s. However, at the time, the nature and function of these cell structures were unclear.

Researchers gained a much better understanding of chromosomes in the early 1900s through Thomas Hunt Morgan's pioneering studies. Morgan made the link between chromosomes and inherited traits by demonstrating that the X chromosome is related to gender and eye color in fruit flies.

# ​Chromosome

## Definition

Chromosomes are threadlike structures made of protein and a single molecule of DNA that serve to carry the genomic information from cell to cell. In plants and animals (including humans), chromosomes reside in the nucleus of cells. Humans have 22 pairs of numbered chromosomes (autosomes) and one pair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY), for a total of 46. Each pair contains two chromosomes, one coming from each parent, which means that children inherit half of their chromosomes from their mother and half from their father. Chromosomes can be seen through a microscope when the nucleus dissolves during cell division.

## Narration

Chromosomes vary in number and shape among living organisms. Most bacteria have one or two circular chromosomes. Humans, along with other animals and plants, have linear chromosomes . In fact, each species of plants and animals has a set number of chromosomes. A fruit fly, for example, has four pairs of chromosomes, while a rice plant has 12 and a dog, 39. In humans, the twenty-third pair is the sex chromosomes, while the first 22 pairs are called autosomes. Typically, biologically female individuals have two X chromosomes (XX) while those who are biologically male have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). However, there are exceptions to these rules. Chromosomes are also different sizes. The human X chromosome is about three times larger than the human Y chromosome, containing about 900 genes, while the Y chromosome has about 55 genes. The unique structure of chromosomes keeps DNA tightly wound around spool-like proteins, called histones. Without such packaging, DNA molecules would be too long to fit inside cells! For example, if all of the DNA molecules in a single human cell were unwound from their histones and placed end-to-end, they would stretch 6 feet.

# What are Chromosomes?

## Each Chromosome Has Many Genes

The human genome includes 21,000 or so genes, spread out along 3 billion base pairs of DNA. This DNA is distributed among 23 chromosomes, of which we have two sets. We inherit one set from each parent.

Each chromosome includes a single, linear molecule of DNA with its own set of genes. Chromosomes are numbered according to their size, and genes are arranged along them in a specific order. So a gene near the tip of the short arm of chromosome 4 in one person will be found in the same location in everyone. This means that each of our genes can be mapped to a specific place on a specific chromosome.

## Genes and Much More

A gene is a segment of DNA instructions for building a particular RNA or protein molecule. Genes are very important, and they get a lot of attention. Yet they make up just 3% of our genome. Each gene is like an island separated by vast stretches of non-coding DNA—that is DNA that does not code for a product. Some of this DNA holds information about which cells should make proteins, when they should make it, and how much they should make. Other segments were left by viruses that infected our ancestors many generations ago. There is some DNA that we know is important—it is conserved between species—but we are not sure exatly why that is. Some DNA appears to have no function.

DNA in other organisms is more than just genes too, though the amount of non-coding DNA varies a lot among species. Bacteria have the smallest genomes, and around 90% of their DNA codes for RNA or protein. At the other end of the spectrum, some plants and protists have enormous genomes, with genes making up as little as 1% of the total DNA.

## Chromosomes Vary in Number and Type

Different organisms have different numbers of chromosomes. Organisms that appear more complex do not always have more chromosomes or genes than less-complex ones.

Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. The first 22 pairs are called autosomes. The last pair are called sex chromosomes, and they are different between males and females. Most females have two X chromosomes (XX), and most males have an X and a Y (XY).

Most other species have different numbers of chromosome pairs than we do. Species also vary in the number of chromosome sets they have. In some species of bees and ants, males have just one copy of every chromosome (they develop from unfertilized eggs), while females have two. Some species of plants have four or more copies of each chromosome. Bacteria have just a single chromosome, arranged in a ring.

Species also differ in how chromosomes specify sex. In birds, the sex chromosomes are called Z and W. Females are ZW and males are ZZ. The tiny roundworm C. elegans has just one type of sex chromosome called X. Those with one X chromosome (known as XO) become male, and those with two X chromosomes become hermaphrodites, meaning they make both eggs and sperm. The platypus has ten sex chromosomes. Females have five pairs of X chromosomes, and males have five X chromosomes and five Y chromosomes. Some turtles do not use sex chromosomes at all. The sex of a baby turtle depends on how warm it was during a critical period as it developed inside its egg.

## Proteins Control Access to Genes

DNA is covered with proteins called histones. DNA wraps around the histones the way sewing thread wraps around a spool. By wrapping DNA more or less tightly, histones control which genes are active (being read to build proteins) and which genes are not.

When a cell gets ready to divide, additional histones attach to DNA, coiling it even tighter.

To learn more about how histones can help regulate access to DNA, visit The Epigenome at a Glance.

# What Are Chromosomes?

The human body is made up of cells. For example, when you have a sunburn and your skin peels, then you are shedding skin cells. In the center of each cell is an area called the nucleus. Human chromosomes are located inside the nucleus of the cell. A chromosome is a structure that holds your genes. Your genes determine your traits, such as eye color and blood type.

The usual number of chromosomes inside every cell of your body is 46 total chromosomes, or 23 pairs. You inherit half of your chromosomes from your biological mother, and the other half from your biological father.

Scientists have numbered the chromosome pairs from 1 to 22, with the 23rd pair labeled as X or Y, depending on the structure. The first 22 pairs of chromosomes are called autosomes. The 23rd pair of chromosomes are known as the sex chromosomes, because they decide if you will be born male or female. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. A picture of all 46 chromosomes in their pairs is called a karyotype. A normal female karyotype is written 46, XX, and a normal male karyotype is written 46, XY.

What is a chromosome?

In the nucleus of each cell, the DNA molecule is packaged into thread-like structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of DNA tightly coiled many times around proteins called histones that support its structure. Chromosomes are not visible in the cell’s nucleus—not even under a microscope—when the cell is not dividing. However, the DNA that makes up chromosomes becomes more tightly packed during cell division and is then visible under a microscope. Most of what researchers know about chromosomes was learned by observing chromosomes during cell division. Each chromosome has a constriction point called the centromere, which divides the chromosome into two sections, or “arms.” The short arm of the chromosome is labeled the “p arm.” The long arm of the chromosome is labeled the “q arm.” The location of the centromere on each chromosome gives the chromosome its characteristic shape, and can be used to help describe the location of specific genes. DNA and histone proteins are packaged into structures called chromosomes. Credit: U.S. National Library of Medicine

# Minute to Understanding: What is a chromosome?

### What is a chromosome? Our cells contain many structures that are essential for living. One of these key structures is a chromosome.

Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of every cell of our body and are made up of DNA, tightly coiled around proteins. We have 23 pairs of chromosomes altogether, and they can only be easily observed during cell division.

So why is our DNA kept in this special packaging? The chromosomes unique structure allows our genetic data to be discreetly kept inside our nuclei. This is important because we have an abundance of genetic data. If the DNA molecules in a single cell were unwound, they would stretch out to six feet long.

The chromosomes unique structure has a few key parts. Each chromosome has two short arms called p arms and two long arms called q arms. These arms are held together at the center by the centromere. The tips of the chromosome are capped by sections of DNA called telomeres. Telomeres protect chromosomes during DNA replication. By keeping our DNA secure, chromosomes make daily activities possible. For an organism to function properly, certain cells must constantly divide and replace older worn out cells with new ones. Chromosomes allow DNA to be accurately copied during these cell divisions.

So one more time. Chromosomes are found in the nuclei of our cells and allow DNA to be accurately copied during cell division. This ensures that our inner workings proceed smoothly and efficiently.

A **chromosome** is a [package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_organization) of [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) containing part or all of the [genetic material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) of an [organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism). In most chromosomes, the very long thin DNA fibers are coated with [nucleosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosome)-forming packaging [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein); in [eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic) cells, the most important of these proteins are the [histones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone). Aided by [chaperone proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_(protein)), the histones bind to and [condense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_condensation) the DNA molecule to maintain its integrity.[1][2] These eukaryotic chromosomes display a complex [three-dimensional structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space) that has a significant role in [transcriptional regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptional_regulation).[3]

Normally, chromosomes are visible under a [light microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_microscope) only during the [metaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphase) of [cell division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division), where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form.[4] Before this stage occurs, each chromosome is duplicated ([S phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_phase)), and the two copies are joined by a [centromere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere)—resulting in either an X-shaped structure if the centromere is located equatorially, or a two-armed structure if the centromere is located distally; the joined copies are called '[sister chromatids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_chromatids)'. During [metaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphase), the duplicated structure (called a 'metaphase chromosome') is highly condensed and thus easiest to distinguish and study.[5] In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in [anaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphase) during [chromosome segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_segregation).[6]

Chromosomal [recombination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination) during [meiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis) and subsequent [sexual reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction) plays a crucial role in [genetic diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity). If these structures are manipulated incorrectly, through processes known as [chromosomal instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_instability) and [translocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation), the cell may undergo [mitotic catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitotic_catastrophe). This will usually cause the cell to initiate [apoptosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis), leading to its own [death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_death), but the process is occasionally hampered by cell mutations that result in the progression of [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer).

The term 'chromosome' is sometimes used in a wider sense to refer to the individualized portions of [chromatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin) in cells, which may or may not be visible under light microscopy. In a narrower sense, 'chromosome' can be used to refer to the individualized portions of chromatin during cell division, which are visible under light microscopy due to high condensation.

## Etymology

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=1)]

The word *chromosome* ([7][8] comes from the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) words χρῶμα (*khrôma*, "colour") and σῶμα (*sôma*, "body"), describing the strong [staining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stain) produced by particular [dyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye).[9] The term was coined by the German anatomist [Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Wilhelm_Waldeyer),[10] referring to the term '[chromatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin)', which was introduced by [Walther Flemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Flemming).

Some of the early [karyological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype) terms have become outdated.[11][12] For example, 'chromatin' (Flemming 1880) and 'chromosom' (Waldeyer 1888) both ascribe color to a non-colored state.[13]

## History of discovery

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=2)]

Walter Sutton (left) and Theodor Boveri (right) independently developed the chromosome theory of inheritance in 1902.

[Otto Bütschli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_B%C3%BCtschli) was the first scientist to recognize the structures now known as chromosomes.[14]

In a series of experiments beginning in the mid-1880s, [Theodor Boveri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Boveri) gave definitive contributions to elucidating that chromosomes are the [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(molecular_biology)) of [heredity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity), with two notions that became known as 'chromosome continuity' and 'chromosome individuality'.[15]

[Wilhelm Roux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Roux) suggested that every chromosome carries a different [genetic configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_load), and Boveri was able to test and confirm this hypothesis. Aided by the rediscovery at the start of the 1900s of [Gregor Mendel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel)'s earlier experimental work, Boveri identified the connection between the rules of inheritance and the behaviour of the chromosomes. Two generations of American [cytologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytologist) were influenced by Boveri: [Edmund Beecher Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Beecher_Wilson), [Nettie Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nettie_Stevens), [Walter Sutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Sutton) and [Theophilus Painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophilus_Painter) (Wilson, Stevens, and Painter actually worked with him).[16]

In his famous textbook, *The Cell in Development and Heredity*, Wilson linked together the independent work of Boveri and Sutton (both around 1902) by naming the chromosome theory of inheritance the '[Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boveri%E2%80%93Sutton_chromosome_theory)' (sometimes known as the 'Sutton–Boveri chromosome theory').[17] [Ernst Mayr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mayr) remarks that the theory was hotly contested by some famous geneticists, including [William Bateson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bateson), [Wilhelm Johannsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Johannsen), [Richard Goldschmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Goldschmidt) and [T.H. Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.H._Morgan), all of a rather dogmatic mindset. Eventually, absolute proof came from chromosome maps in Morgan's own laboratory.[18]

The number of human chromosomes was published by Painter in 1923. By inspection through a microscope, he counted 24 pairs of chromosomes, giving 48 in total. His error was copied by others, and it was not until 1956 that the true number (46) was determined by Indonesian-born [cytogeneticist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogeneticist) [Joe Hin Tjio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hin_Tjio).[19]

## Prokaryotes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=3)]

Main article: [Nucleoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoid)

The [prokaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote) – [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria) and [archaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea) – typically have a single [circular chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_chromosome).[20] The chromosomes of most bacteria (also called [genophores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genophore)), can range in size from only 130,000 [base pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair) in the [endosymbiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiotic) bacteria *Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola*[21] and *Candidatus Tremblaya princeps*,[22] to more than 14,000,000 base pairs in the soil-dwelling bacterium *Sorangium cellulosum*.[23]

Some bacteria have more than one chromosome. For instance, [Spirochaetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirochaete) such as *Borrelia burgdorferi* (causing [Lyme disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease)), contain a single *linear* chromosome.[24] *Vibrios* typically carry two chromosomes of very different size. Genomes of the genus *Burkholderia* carry one, two, or three chromosomes.[25]

### Structure in sequences

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=4)]

Prokaryotic chromosomes have less sequence-based structure than eukaryotes. Bacteria typically have a one-point (the [origin of replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_replication)) from which replication starts, whereas some archaea contain multiple replication origins.[26] The genes in prokaryotes are often organized in [operons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operon) and do not usually contain [introns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron), unlike eukaryotes.

### DNA packaging

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=5)]

[Prokaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote) do not possess nuclei. Instead, their DNA is organized into a structure called the [nucleoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoid).[27][28] The nucleoid is a distinct structure and occupies a defined region of the bacterial cell. This structure is, however, dynamic and is maintained and remodeled by the actions of a range of histone-like proteins, which associate with the bacterial chromosome.[29] In [archaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaea), the DNA in chromosomes is even more organized, with the DNA packaged within structures similar to eukaryotic nucleosomes.[30][31]

Certain bacteria also contain [plasmids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid) or other [extrachromosomal DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrachromosomal_DNA). These are circular structures in the [cytoplasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm) that contain cellular DNA and play a role in [horizontal gene transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer).[5] In prokaryotes and viruses,[32] the DNA is often densely packed and organized; in the case of archaea, by homology to eukaryotic histones, and in the case of bacteria, by [histone-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone-like_nucleoid-structuring_protein) proteins.

Bacterial chromosomes tend to be tethered to the [plasma membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_membrane) of the bacteria. In molecular biology application, this allows for its isolation from plasmid DNA by centrifugation of lysed bacteria and pelleting of the membranes (and the attached DNA).

Prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids are, like eukaryotic DNA, generally [supercoiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercoiled). The DNA must first be released into its relaxed state for access for [transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)), regulation, and [replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication).

## Eukaryotes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=6)]

Main article: [Chromatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin)

See also: [DNA condensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_condensation), [Chromosome condensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_condensation), [Nucleosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosome), [Histone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone), and [Protamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protamine)

See also: [Eukaryotic chromosome fine structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic_chromosome_fine_structure)

Organization of DNA in a eukaryotic cell

Each eukaryotic chromosome consists of a long linear [DNA molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) associated with [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein), forming a compact complex of proteins and DNA called *chromatin.* Chromatin contains the vast majority of the DNA in an organism, but a [small amount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA) inherited maternally can be found in the [mitochondria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria). It is present in most [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)), with a few exceptions, for example, [red blood cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell).

[Histones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone) are responsible for the first and most basic unit of chromosome organization, the [nucleosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosome).

[Eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote) ([cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) with nuclei such as those found in plants, fungi, and animals) possess multiple large linear chromosomes contained in the cell's nucleus. Each chromosome has one [centromere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere), with one or two arms projecting from the centromere, although, under most circumstances, these arms are not visible as such. In addition, most eukaryotes have a small circular [mitochondrial genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_genome), and some eukaryotes may have additional small circular or linear [cytoplasmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm) chromosomes.

The major structures in DNA compaction: [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA), the [nucleosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosome), the 10 nm "beads-on-a-string" fibre, the 30 nm fibre and the [metaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphase) chromosome

In the nuclear chromosomes of eukaryotes, the uncondensed DNA exists in a semi-ordered structure, where it is wrapped around [histones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone) (structural proteins), forming a composite material called chromatin.

### Interphase chromatin

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=7)]

The packaging of DNA into nucleosomes causes a 10 nanometer fibre which may further condense up to 30 nm fibres.[33] Most of the euchromatin in interphase nuclei appears to be in the form of 30-nm fibers.[33] Chromatin structure is the more decondensed state, i.e. the 10-nm conformation allows transcription.[33]

Heterochromatin vs. euchromatin

During [interphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interphase) (the period of the [cell cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle) where the cell is not dividing), two types of chromatin can be distinguished:

- [Euchromatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchromatin), which consists of DNA that is active, e.g., being expressed as protein. - [Heterochromatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromatin), which consists of mostly inactive DNA. It seems to serve structural purposes during the chromosomal stages. Heterochromatin can be further distinguished into two types: Constitutive heterochromatin, which is never expressed. It is located around the centromere and usually contains repetitive sequences. Facultative heterochromatin, which is sometimes expressed.

### Metaphase chromatin and division

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=8)]

See also: [chromosome condensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_condensation), [mitosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis), and [meiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis)

Human chromosomes during [metaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphase)

Stages of early mitosis in a vertebrate cell with micrographs of chromatids

In the early stages of [mitosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis) or [meiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis) (cell division), the chromatin double helix becomes more and more condensed. They cease to function as accessible genetic material ([transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)) stops) and become a compact transportable form. The loops of thirty-nanometer chromatin fibers are thought to fold upon themselves further to form the compact metaphase chromosomes of mitotic cells. The DNA is thus condensed about ten-thousand-fold.[33]

The [chromosome scaffold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_scaffold), which is made of proteins such as [condensin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensin), [TOP2A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP2A) and [KIF4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIF4A),[34] plays an important role in holding the chromatin into compact chromosomes. Loops of thirty-nanometer structure further condense with scaffold into higher order structures.[35]

This highly compact form makes the individual chromosomes visible, and they form the classic four-arm structure, a pair of sister [chromatids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatid) attached to each other at the [centromere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere). The shorter arms are called *p arms* (from the French *petit*, small) and the longer arms are called *q arms* (*q* follows *p* in the Latin alphabet; q-g "grande"; alternatively it is sometimes said q is short for *queue* meaning tail in French[36]). This is the only natural context in which individual chromosomes are visible with an optical [microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope).

Mitotic metaphase chromosomes are best described by a linearly organized longitudinally compressed array of consecutive chromatin loops.[37]

During mitosis, [microtubules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule) grow from centrosomes located at opposite ends of the cell and also attach to the centromere at specialized structures called [kinetochores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetochore), one of which is present on each sister [chromatid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatid). A special DNA base sequence in the region of the kinetochores provides, along with special proteins, longer-lasting attachment in this region. The microtubules then pull the chromatids apart toward the centrosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits one set of chromatids. Once the cells have divided, the chromatids are uncoiled and DNA can again be transcribed. In spite of their appearance, chromosomes are structurally highly condensed, which enables these giant DNA structures to be contained within a cell nucleus.

### Human chromosomes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=9)]

Chromosomes in humans can be divided into two types: [autosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome) (body chromosome(s)) and allosome ([sex chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_chromosome)(s)). Certain genetic traits are linked to a person's sex and are passed on through the sex chromosomes. The autosomes contain the rest of the genetic hereditary information. All act in the same way during cell division. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes), giving a total of 46 per cell. In addition to these, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the [mitochondrial genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_genome). [Sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing) of the [human genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome) has provided a great deal of information about each of the chromosomes. Below is a table compiling statistics for the chromosomes, based on the [Sanger Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_Institute)'s human genome information in the [Vertebrate Genome Annotation (VEGA) database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_and_Genome_Annotation_Project).[38] Number of genes is an estimate, as it is in part based on [gene predictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_prediction). Total chromosome length is an estimate as well, based on the estimated size of unsequenced [heterochromatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromatin) regions.

| Chromosome | Genes[39] | Total base pairs | % of bases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Total | 21,000 | 3,079,843,747 | 100.0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Based on the micrographic characteristics of size, position of the [centromere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere) and sometimes the presence of a [chromosomal satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_satellite), the human chromosomes are classified into the following groups:[41][42]

| Group | Chromosomes | Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 1–3 | Large, metacentric or submetacentric |
| B | 4–5 | Large, submetacentric |
| C | 6–12, X | Medium-sized, submetacentric |
| D | 13–15 | Medium-sized, acrocentric, with satellite |
| E | 16–18 | Small, metacentric or submetacentric |
| F | 19–20 | Very small, metacentric |
| G | 21–22, Y | Very small, acrocentric (and 21, 22 with satellite) |

## Karyotype

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=10)]

Main article: [Karyotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype)

Karyogram of a human male

Schematic [karyogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyogram) of a human, with annotated [bands and sub-bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)). It is a graphical representation of the idealized human [diploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid) karyotype. It shows dark and white regions on [G banding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_banding). Each row is vertically aligned at [centromere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere) level. It shows 22 [homologous chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_chromosome), both the female (XX) and male (XY) versions of the [sex chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_chromosome) (bottom right), as well as the [mitochondrial genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mitochondrial_genetics) (at bottom left). Further information: Karyotype

In general, the [karyotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype) is the characteristic chromosome complement of a [eukaryote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote) [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species).[43] The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of [cytogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytogenetics).

Although the [replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication) and [transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(genetics)) of [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) is highly standardized in eukaryotes, the same cannot be said for their karyotypes, which are often highly variable. There may be variation between species in chromosome number and in detailed organization. In some cases, there is significant variation within species. Often there is:

1. variation between the two sexes 2. variation between the germline and soma (between gametes and the rest of the body) 3. variation between members of a population, due to balanced genetic polymorphism 4. geographical variation between races 5. mosaics or otherwise abnormal individuals.

Also, variation in karyotype may occur during development from the fertilized egg.

The technique of determining the karyotype is usually called *karyotyping*. Cells can be locked part-way through division (in metaphase) [in vitro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro) (in a reaction vial) with [colchicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicine). These cells are then stained, photographed, and arranged into a *karyogram*, with the set of chromosomes arranged, autosomes in order of length, and sex chromosomes (here X/Y) at the end.

Like many sexually reproducing species, humans have special [gonosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system) (sex chromosomes, in contrast to [autosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome)). These are XX in females and XY in males.

### History and analysis techniques

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=11)]

See also: [Argument from authority § Use in science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority#Use_in_science)

Investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question: *How many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain?* In 1912, [Hans von Winiwarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hans_von_Winiwarter&action=edit&redlink=1) reported 47 chromosomes in [spermatogonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatogonia) and 48 in [oogonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oogonia), concluding an [XX/XO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XO_sex-determination_system) [sex determination mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-determination_system).[44] In 1922, [Painter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophilus_Painter) was not certain whether the diploid number of man is 46 or 48, at first favouring 46.[45] He revised his opinion later from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on humans having an [XX/XY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system) system.[46]

New techniques were needed to definitively solve the problem:

1. Using cells in culture 2. Arresting [mitosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis) in [metaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphase) by a solution of [colchicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicine) 3. Pretreating cells in a [hypotonic solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotonicity) 0.075 M KCl, which swells them and spreads the chromosomes 4. Squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane 5. Cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram.

It took until 1954 before the human diploid number was confirmed as 46.[47][48] Considering the techniques of Winiwarter and Painter, their results were quite remarkable.[49] [Chimpanzees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(genus)), the closest living relatives to modern humans, have 48 chromosomes as do the other [great apes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_apes): in humans two chromosomes fused to form [chromosome 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_2).

## Aberrations

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=12)]

Main article: [Chromosome abnormality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_abnormality)

In Down syndrome, there are three copies of chromosome 21.

Chromosomal aberrations are disruptions in the normal chromosomal content of a cell. They can cause genetic conditions in humans, such as [Down syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome),[50] although most aberrations have little to no effect. Some chromosome abnormalities do not cause disease in carriers, such as [translocations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation), or [chromosomal inversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_inversion), although they may lead to a higher chance of bearing a child with a chromosome disorder.[citation needed] Abnormal numbers of chromosomes or chromosome sets, called [aneuploidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy), may be lethal or may give rise to genetic disorders.[51] [Genetic counseling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counseling) is offered for families that may carry a chromosome rearrangement.

The gain or loss of DNA from chromosomes can lead to a variety of [genetic disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder).[52] Human examples include:

- [Cri du chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cri_du_chat), caused by the [deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_deletion) of part of the short arm of chromosome 5. "Cri du chat" means "cry of the cat" in French; the condition was so-named because affected babies make high-pitched cries that sound like those of a cat. Affected individuals have wide-set eyes, a small head and jaw, moderate to severe mental health problems, and are very short. - [DiGeorge syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiGeorge_syndrome), also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Symptoms are mild learning disabilities in children, with adults having an increased risk of [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia). Infections are also common in children because of problems with the immune system's T cell-mediated response due to an absence of hypoplastic thymus.[53] - [Down syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome), the most common trisomy, usually caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 ([trisomy 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy_21)). Characteristics include decreased muscle tone, stockier build, asymmetrical skull, slanting eyes, and mild to moderate developmental disability.[54] - [Edwards syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_syndrome), or trisomy-18, the second most common trisomy.[55] Symptoms include motor retardation, developmental disability, and numerous congenital anomalies causing serious health problems. Ninety percent of those affected die in infancy. They have characteristic clenched hands and overlapping fingers. - [Isodicentric 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isodicentric_15), also called idic(15), partial tetrasomy 15q, or inverted duplication 15 (inv dup 15). - [Jacobsen syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobsen_syndrome), which is very rare. It is also called the 11q terminal deletion disorder.[56] Those affected have normal intelligence or mild developmental disability, with poor expressive language skills. Most have a bleeding disorder called [Paris-Trousseau syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Trousseau_syndrome). - [Klinefelter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome) (XXY). Men with Klinefelter syndrome are usually sterile, and tend to be taller than their peers, with longer arms and legs. Boys with the syndrome are often shy and quiet, and have a higher incidence of [speech delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_delay) and [dyslexia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia). Without testosterone treatment, some may develop [gynecomastia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecomastia) during puberty. - [Patau Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patau_Syndrome), also called D-Syndrome or trisomy-13. Symptoms are somewhat similar to those of trisomy-18, without the characteristic folded hand. - [Small supernumerary marker chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_supernumerary_marker_chromosome). This means there is an extra, abnormal chromosome. Features depend on the origin of the extra genetic material. [Cat-eye syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat-eye_syndrome) and [isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isodicentric_chromosome_15_syndrome) (or Idic15) are both caused by a supernumerary marker chromosome, as is [Pallister–Killian syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallister%E2%80%93Killian_syndrome). - [Triple-X syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-X_syndrome) (XXX). XXX girls tend to be tall and thin, and have a higher incidence of dyslexia. - [Turner syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_syndrome) (X instead of XX or XY). In Turner syndrome, female sexual characteristics are present but underdeveloped. Females with Turner syndrome often have a short stature, low hairline, abnormal eye features and bone development, and a "caved-in" appearance to the chest. - [Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Hirschhorn_syndrome), caused by partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4. It is characterized by growth retardation, delayed motor skills development, "Greek Helmet" facial features, and mild to profound mental health problems. - [XYY syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYY_syndrome). XYY boys are usually taller than their siblings. Like XXY boys and XXX girls, they are more likely to have learning difficulties.

### Sperm aneuploidy

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=13)]

Exposure of males to certain lifestyle, environmental and/or occupational hazards may increase the risk of aneuploid spermatozoa.[57] In particular, risk of aneuploidy is increased by tobacco smoking,[58][59] and occupational exposure to benzene,[60] [insecticides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide),[61][62] and perfluorinated compounds.[63] Increased aneuploidy is often associated with increased DNA damage in spermatozoa.

## Number in various organisms

### In eukaryotes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=15)]

The number of chromosomes in [eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote) is highly variable. It is possible for chromosomes to fuse or break and thus evolve into novel karyotypes. Chromosomes can also be fused artificially. For example, when the 16 chromosomes of [yeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae) were fused into one giant chromosome, it was found that the cells were still viable with only somewhat reduced growth rates.[64]

The tables below give the total number of chromosomes (including sex chromosomes) in a cell nucleus for various eukaryotes. Most are [diploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid), such as [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human#Genetics) who have 22 different types of [autosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome)—each present as two homologous pairs—and two [sex chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_chromosome), giving 46 chromosomes in total. Some other organisms have more than two copies of their chromosome types, for example [bread wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_wheat) which is *hexaploid*, having six copies of seven different chromosome types for a total of 42 chromosomes.

Normal members of a particular eukaryotic species all have the same number of nuclear chromosomes. Other eukaryotic chromosomes, i.e., mitochondrial and plasmid-like small chromosomes, are much more variable in number, and there may be thousands of copies per cell.

The 23 human [chromosome territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_territories) during [prometaphase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometaphase) in [fibroblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast) cells

[Asexually reproducing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexually_reproducing) species have one set of chromosomes that are the same in all body cells. However, asexual species can be either haploid or diploid.

[Sexually reproducing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_reproducing) species have [somatic cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_cell) (body cells) that are [diploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploid) [2n], having two sets of chromosomes (23 pairs in humans), one set from the mother and one from the father. [Gametes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete) (reproductive cells) are [haploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haploid) [n], having one set of chromosomes. Gametes are produced by [meiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis) of a diploid [germline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germline) cell, during which the matching chromosomes of father and mother can exchange small parts of themselves ([crossover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover)) and thus create new chromosomes that are not inherited solely from either parent. When a male and a female gamete merge during [fertilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilization), a new diploid organism is formed.

Some animal and plant species are [polyploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid) [Xn], having more than two sets of [homologous chromosomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous_chromosome). Important crops such as tobacco or wheat are often polyploid, compared to their ancestral species. Wheat has a haploid number of seven chromosomes, still seen in some [cultivars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar) as well as the wild progenitors. The more common types of pasta and bread wheat are polyploid, having 28 (tetraploid) and 42 (hexaploid) chromosomes, compared to the 14 (diploid) chromosomes in wild wheat.[90]

### In prokaryotes

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome&action=edit&section=16)]

[Prokaryote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote) species generally have one copy of each major chromosome, but most cells can easily survive with multiple copies.[91] For example, *Buchnera*, a [symbiont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiont) of [aphids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid), has multiple copies of its chromosome, ranging from 10 to 400 copies per cell.[92] However, in some large bacteria, such as *Epulopiscium fishelsoni* up to 100,000 copies of the chromosome can be present.[93] Plasmids and plasmid-like small chromosomes are, as in eukaryotes, highly variable in copy number. The number of plasmids in the cell is almost entirely determined by the rate of division of the plasmid – fast division causes high copy number.

# Chromosomes

Cells package their DNA not only to protect it, but also to regulate which genes are accessed and when. Cellular genes are therefore similar to valuable files stored in a file cabinet — but in this case, the cabinet's drawers are constantly opening and closing; various files are continually being located, pulled, and copied; and the original files are always returned to the correct location.

Of course, just as file drawers help conserve space in an office, DNA packaging helps conserve space in cells. Packaging is the reason why the approximately two meters of human DNA can fit into a cell that is only a few micrometers wide. But how, exactly, is DNA compacted to fit within eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells? And what mechanisms do cells use to access this highly compacted genetic material?

## What Are Chromosomes?

Cellular DNA is never bare and unaccompanied by other proteins. Rather, it always forms a complex with various protein partners that help package it into such a tiny space. This DNA-protein complex is called chromatin, wherein the mass of protein and nucleic acid is nearly equal. Within cells, chromatin usually folds into characteristic formations called chromosomes. Each chromosome contains a single double-stranded piece of DNA along with the aforementioned packaging proteins.

Eukaryotes typically possess multiple pairs of linear chromosomes, all of which are contained in the cellular nucleus, and these chromosomes have characteristic and changeable forms. During cell division, for example, they become more tightly packed, and their condensed form can be visualized with a light microscope. This condensed form is approximately 10,000 times shorter than the linear DNA strand would be if it was devoid of proteins and pulled taut. However, when eukaryotic cells are not dividing — a stage called interphase — the chromatin within their chromosomes is less tightly packed. This looser configuration is important because it permits transcription to take place (Figure 1, Figure 2).

In contrast to eukaryotes, the DNA in prokaryotic cells is generally present in a single circular chromosome that is located in the cytoplasm. (Recall that prokaryotic cells do not possess a nucleus.) Prokaryotic chromosomes are less condensed than their eukaryotic counterparts and don't have easily identified features when viewed under a light microscope.

## How Are Eukaryotic Chromosomes Structured?

Nucleosomes are made up of double-stranded DNA that has complexed with small proteins called histones. The core particle of each nucleosome consists of eight histone molecules, two each of four different histone types: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The structure of histones has been strongly conserved across evolution, suggesting that their DNA packaging function is crucially important to all eukaryotic cells (Figure 4).

Histones carry positive charges and bind negatively charged DNA in a specific conformation. In particular, a segment of the DNA double helix wraps around each histone core particle a little less than twice. The exact length of the DNA segment associated with each histone core varies from species to species, but most such segments are approximately 150 base pairs in length. Furthermore, each histone molecule within the core particle has one end that sticks out from the particle. These ends are called N-terminal tails, and they play an important role in higher-order chromatin structure and gene expression.

## Why Is Complex Packing Critical for Eukaryotic Chromosomes?

The multiple levels of packing that exist within eukaryotic chromosomes not only permit a large amount of DNA to occupy a very small space, but they also serve several functional roles. For example, the looping of nucleosome-containing fibers brings specific regions of chromatin together, thereby influencing gene expression. In fact, the organized packing of DNA is malleable and appears to be highly regulated in cells.

Chromatin packing also offers an additional mechanism for controlling gene expression. Specifically, cells can control access to their DNA by modifying the structure of their chromatin. Highly compacted chromatin simply isn't accessible to the enzymes involved in DNA transcription, replication, or repair. Thus, regions of chromatin where active transcription is taking place (called euchromatin) are less condensed than regions where transcription is inactive or is being actively inhibited or repressed (called heterochromatin) (Figure 6).

The dynamic nature of chromatin is regulated by enzymes. For example, chromatin can be loosened by changing the position of the DNA strands within a nucleosome. This loosening occurs because of chromatin remodeling enzymes, which function to slide nucleosomes along the DNA strand so that other enzymes can access the strand. This process is closely regulated and allows specific genes to be accessed in response to metabolic signals within the cell. Another way cells control gene expression is by modifying their histones with small chemical groups, such as methyl and acetyl groups in the N-terminal tails that extend from the core particle. Different enzymes catalyze each kind of N-terminal modification. Scientists occasionally refer to the complex pattern of histone modification in cells as a "histone code." Some of these modifications increase gene expression, whereas others decrease it.

## How Are Chromosomes Organized in the Nucleus?

In electron micrographs, eukaryotic interphase chromatin appears much like a plate of spaghetti — in other words, there is no obvious pattern of organization. In recent years, however, investigators have begun using fluorescent probes for each of the different interphase chromosomes. In doing so, they have discovered that these chromosomes have functional and decidedly nonrandom arrangements.

One of the first things these scientists noted was that uncondensed chromosomes occupy characteristic regions of the nucleus, which they termed chromosome territories. The spatial localization of these territories is thought to be important for gene expression. In fact, with the advent of gene-specific probes, researchers are beginning to understand how the arrangement of chromosome territories can bring particular genes closer together. A second major observation related to chromosome territories is that the position of chromosomes relative to one another differs from cell to cell. Such differences reflect variation in gene expression patterns.

# Chromosomes

Chromosomes are long strings of DNA wrapped around proteins to make them compact. They’re a way for cells to organize and store your DNA. Humans typically have 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes. The first 22 are called autosomes and the last pair are sex chromosomes.

## Overview

### What are chromosomes?

Chromosomes are long strings of DNA (instructions that make your body work), wrapped around special proteins (histones) to make them compact enough to fit into the nucleus of your cells. Your chromosomes are like individual books in your DNA library. Every one of your cells, except red blood cells and platelets, carries copies of your chromosomes.

Like socks or gloves, your chromosomes come in pairs. Humans typically have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. Pairs 1 through 22 are called autosomes. The last pair is called sex chromosomes.

#### Autosomes

Typically, people have two copies of chromosomes 1 through 22 (autosomes) — you inherit one from each biological parent. Autosomes have anywhere from 750 to 2,800 genes (segments of DNA) on them that give your body the instructions it needs to function.

You generally need two copies of each set of instructions to live. Only in very rare cases can someone survive with only one of any given autosome. Some people have three of certain autosomes (like chromosome 21). But most conditions that cause extra autosomes aren’t survivable.

#### Sex chromosomes

Sex chromosomes can either be an X or a Y. Everyone gets an X chromosome from their biological mother. Females get an additional X from their biological father. Males get a Y from their biological father. So, your 23rd pair of chromosomes is typically either two Xs or an X and a Y. But some people have:

- More than one Y

- More than two Xs

- Two Xs and a Y

- Only one X

X is similar to an autosome. It has over 1,000 genes, and you can’t survive without at least one X chromosome. Experts estimate that the Y chromosome has far fewer genes than the X chromosomes or your autosomes. Its main role is in developing the male reproductive system.

##### X inactivation

Your body deactivates all but one X chromosome in every cell. So, if you have two X chromosomes (or any number more than one), each cell will only carry one active copy. This is called X inactivation or Lyonization. The active X isn’t the same in every cell.

For example, if you have two Xs, your cells will carry the X from both your biological parents. But some cells will have the X from your mother activated and some will have the X from your father activated. The other will be deactivated.

## Function

### What do chromosomes do?

Chromosomes are a way for your body to organize and store DNA. Having two copies of each chromosome ensures that you get the right amount of proteins made by the genes on those chromosomes. This system can also protect you from some diseases. Having an extra copy of every gene on a chromosome means that if something goes wrong with one copy, the other one might be able to cover for it.

## Anatomy

### Chromosome structure

If you look at chromosomes under a microscope (they’re too small to see with just your eye), they might look like a squiggly line or a worm. What you’re actually looking at are long strings of DNA wrapped around nucleosomes — or clusters of histones — to make structures called chromatin. The chromatin is then further wrapped around other special proteins to create chromosomes.

Sometimes, you’ll see chromosomes that look like an X. This is a chromosome during cell division, about to make another copy of itself. It has two short arms and two long arms, all connected near the middle. You might see an image of a complete set of chromosomes on an arrangement called a karyotype.

### What are the parts of a chromosome?

Parts of a chromosome include:

- Arms: Each chromosome has a short segment (labeled “p”) and a long segment (labeled “q”) called arms. The arms are made up of packaged chromatin. They meet at the centromere.

- Centromere: The centromere is an area near the center of a chromosome that ensures that genetic material divides equally when your cells make more copies of themselves.

- Telomeres: These are repeating DNA segments that protect the ends of the chromosome.

## Conditions and Disorders

### Chromosomal conditions

Sometimes, a set of chromosomes may be different in ways that cause health issues. These differences include:

- Having more or fewer than 46 chromosomes (aneuploidy), like trisomy, monosomy and triploidy

- Having parts missing from one or more chromosomes

- Having pieces of two chromosomes swap places in the middle of a gene, creating a fusion gene

These issues can lead to:

- Cancer

- Cri du chat syndrome

- Down syndrome

- Klinefelter syndrome

- Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)

- Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome)

- Miscarriage

- Triple X syndrome

- Turner syndrome

- Williams syndrome

- Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome

- XYY syndrome (Jacobs syndrome)

A well-known example of a fusion gene is the “Philadelphia chromosome” (BCR::ABL1 fusion gene), when pieces of chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 break off and change places. This causes certain types of leukemia.

### A note from Cleveland Clinic

Just like a library is organized and structured into books, your chromosomes organize your DNA. Instead of pieces of paper bound together, your DNA is wrapped around proteins and protected with telomere caps. It’s a handy way for each of your cells to carry all the information they need to tell the story of you.

**Title:** Karyotype

**Source:** valyu/valyu-wikipedia

**Content:**
A karyotype is a preparation of the complete set of metaphase chromosomes in the cells of a species or in an individual organism, sorted by length, centromere location and other features.  and for a test that detects this complement or counts the number of chromosomes. Karyotyping is the process by which a karyotype is prepared from photographs of chromosomes, in order to determine the chromosome complement of an individual, including the number of chromosomes and any abnormalities.

Karyotypes describe the chromosome count of an organism and what these chromosomes look like under a light microscope. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the centromeres, banding pattern, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and any other physical characteristics. The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics.

The study of whole sets of chromosomes is sometimes known as karyology. The chromosomes are depicted (by rearranging a photomicrograph) in a standard format known as a karyogram or idiogram: in pairs, ordered by size and position of centromere for chromosomes of the same size.

The basic number of chromosomes in the somatic cells of an individual or a species is called the somatic number and is designated 2n. In the germ-line (the sex cells) the chromosome number is n (humans: n = 23).p28 Thus, in humans 2n = 46.

So, in normal diploid organisms, autosomal chromosomes are present in two copies. There may, or may not, be sex chromosomes. Polyploid cells have multiple copies of chromosomes and haploid cells have single copies.

Karyotypes can be used for many purposes; such as to study chromosomal aberrations, cellular function, taxonomic relationships, medicine and to gather information about past evolutionary events (karyosystematics).

History of karyotype studies 
Chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by Carl Wilhelm von Nägeli in 1842. Their behavior in animal (salamander) cells was described by Walther Flemming, the discoverer of mitosis, in 1882. The name was coined by another German anatomist, Heinrich von Waldeyer in 1888. It is New Latin from Ancient Greek κάρυον karyon, "kernel", "seed", or "nucleus", and τύπος typos, "general form")

The next stage took place after the development of genetics in the early 20th century, when it was appreciated that chromosomes (that can be observed by karyotype) were the carrier of genes.  in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes, in contrast to their genic contents. The subsequent history of the concept can be followed in the works of C. D. Darlington and Michael JD White.

Investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question: how many chromosomes does a normal diploid human cell contain? In 1912, Hans von Winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in spermatogonia and 48 in oogonia, concluding an XX/XO sex determination mechanism. Painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid of humans was 46 or 48, at first favoring 46, but revised his opinion from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on humans having an XX/XY system. Considering the techniques of the time, these results were remarkable.

Joe Hin Tjio working in Albert Levan's lab found the chromosome count to be 46 using new techniques available at the time:
 Using cells in tissue culture
 Pretreating cells in a hypotonic solution, which swells them and spreads the chromosomes
 Arresting mitosis in metaphase by a solution of colchicine
 Squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane
 Cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram.

The work took place in 1955, and was published in 1956. The karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes. The other great apes have 48 chromosomes. Human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes.

Observations on karyotypes

Staining 
The study of karyotypes is made possible by staining. Usually, a suitable dye, such as Giemsa, is applied after cells have been arrested during cell division by a solution of colchicine usually in metaphase or prometaphase when most condensed. In order for the Giemsa stain to adhere correctly, all chromosomal proteins must be digested and removed. For humans,  white blood cells are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in tissue culture. Sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing (interphase) cells. The sex of an unborn fetus can be determined by observation of interphase cells (see amniotic centesis and Barr body).

Observations 
Six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared:
 Differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes.  Chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family.  For example, the legumes Lotus tenuis and Vicia faba each have six pairs of chromosomes, yet V. faba chromosomes are many times larger.  These differences probably reflect different amounts of DNA duplication.
 Differences in the position of centromeres.  These differences probably came about through translocations.
 Differences in relative size of chromosomes.  These differences probably arose from segmental interchange of unequal lengths.
 Differences in basic number of chromosomes.  These differences could have resulted from successive unequal translocations which removed all the essential genetic material from a chromosome, permitting its loss without penalty to the organism (the dislocation hypothesis) or through fusion.  Humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes.  Human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes, and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes.
 Differences in number and position of satellites.  Satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread.
 Differences in degree and distribution of heterochromatic regions.  Heterochromatin stains darker than euchromatin.  Heterochromatin is packed tighter.  Heterochromatin consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive DNA sequences as well as containing a larger amount of Adenine-Thymine pairs.  Euchromatin is usually under active transcription and stains much lighter as it has less affinity for the giemsa stain. Euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of Guanine-Cytosine pairs. The staining technique using giemsa staining is called G banding and therefore produces the typical "G-Bands".

A full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number, type, shape and banding of the chromosomes, as well as other cytogenetic information.

Variation is often found:
 between the sexes,
 between the germ-line and soma (between gametes and the rest of the body),
 between members of a population (chromosome polymorphism),
 in geographic specialization, and
 in mosaics or otherwise abnormal individuals.

Human karyotype

The typical human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes (allosomes). The most common karyotypes for females contain two X chromosomes and are denoted 46,XX; males usually have both an X and a Y chromosome denoted 46,XY. Approximately 1.7% percent of humans are intersex, sometimes due to variations in sex chromosomes.

Some variations in karyotype, whether to autosomes or allosomes, cause developmental abnormalities.

**Title:** Centromere
**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centromere?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral
**Source:** valyu/valyu-wikipedia

**Content:**
The centromere links a pair of sister chromatids together during cell division. This constricted region of chromosome connects the sister chromatids, creating a short arm (p) and a long arm (q) on the chromatids. During mitosis, spindle fibers attach to the centromere via the kinetochore.

The physical role of the centromere is to act as the site of assembly of the kinetochores – a highly complex multiprotein structure that is responsible for the actual events of chromosome segregation – i.e. binding microtubules and signaling to the cell cycle machinery when all chromosomes have adopted correct attachments to the spindle, so that it is safe for cell division to proceed to completion and for cells to enter anaphase.

There are, broadly speaking, two types of centromeres. "Point centromeres" bind to specific proteins that recognize particular DNA sequences with high efficiency. Any piece of DNA with the point centromere DNA sequence on it will typically form a centromere if present in the appropriate species. The best characterized point centromeres are those of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. "Regional centromeres" is the term coined to describe most centromeres, which typically form on regions of preferred DNA sequence, but which can form on other DNA sequences as well. The signal for formation of a regional centromere appears to be epigenetic. Most organisms, ranging from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans, have regional centromeres.

Regarding mitotic chromosome structure, centromeres represent a constricted region of the chromosome (often referred to as the primary constriction) where two identical sister chromatids are most closely in contact. When cells enter mitosis, the sister chromatids (the two copies of each chromosomal DNA molecule resulting from DNA replication in chromatin form) are linked along their length by the action of the cohesin complex. It is now believed that this complex is mostly released from chromosome arms during prophase, so that by the time the chromosomes line up at the mid-plane of the mitotic spindle (also known as the metaphase plate), the last place where they are linked with one another is in the chromatin in and around the centromere.

Position

Each chromosome has two arms, labeled p (the shorter of the two) and q (the longer). Many remember that the short arm 'p' is named for the French word "petit" meaning 'small', although this explanation was shown to be apocryphal. They can be connected in either metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric or telocentric manner.

|}

Metacentric 
Metacentric means that the centromere is positioned midway between the chromosome ends, resulting in the arms being approximately equal in length. When the centromeres are metacentric, the chromosomes appear to be "x-shaped."

Submetacentric 
Submetacentric means that the centromere is positioned below the middle, with one chromosome arm shorter than the other, often resulting in an L shape.

Acrocentric 
An acrocentric chromosome's centromere is situated so that one of the chromosome arms is much shorter than the other. The "acro-" in acrocentric refers to the Greek word for "peak." The human genome includes six acrocentric chromosomes. Five autosomal acrocentric chromosomes: 13, 14, 15, 21, 22; and the Y chromosome is also acrocentric.

Short acrocentric p-arms contain little genetic material and can be translocated without significant harm, as in a balanced Robertsonian translocation. In addition to some protein coding genes, human acrocentric p-arms also contain Nucleolus organizer regions (NORs), from which ribosomal RNA is transcribed. However, a proportion of acrocentric p-arms in cell lines and tissues from normal human donors do not contain detectable NORs. The domestic horse genome includes one metacentric chromosome that is homologous to two acrocentric chromosomes in the conspecific but undomesticated Przewalski's horse. This may reflect either fixation of a balanced Robertsonian translocation in domestic horses or, conversely, fixation of the fission of one metacentric chromosome into two acrocentric chromosomes in Przewalski's horses. A similar situation exists between the human and great ape genomes, with a reduction of two acrocentric chromosomes in the great apes to one metacentric chromosome in humans (see aneuploidy and the human chromosome 2).

Many diseases from the result of unbalanced translocations more frequently involve acrocentric chromosomes than other non-acrocentric chromosomes. Acrocentric chromosomes are usually located in and around the nucleolus. As a result these chromosomes tend to be less densely packed than chromosomes in the nuclear periphery. Consistently, chromosomal regions that are less densely packed are also more prone to chromosomal translocations in cancers.

Telocentric 
Telocentric chromosomes' centromeres are located at one end of the chromosome. Telocentric centromeres often result in the p arms being barely or not visible at all.

If the telocentric chromosome's centromere is located at the terminal end of the chromosome, then the chromosome only has one arm. Naturally occurring telocentric chromosomes with a terminal centromere are rare, but do exist. Telocentric chromosomes are not present in healthy humans. Misdivision of centromeres in normal chromosomes lead to the development of telosomes. The structure of the telosomes kinetochores determines their cytological stability.

The standard house mouse karyotype has only telocentric chromosomes.

Subtelocentric 
Subtelocentric chromosomes' centromeres are located between the middle and the end of the chromosomes, but reside closer to the end of the chromosomes.

Centromere number

Acentric 
An acentric chromosome is fragment of a chromosome that lacks a centromere. Since centromeres are the attachment point for spindle fibers in cell division, acentric fragments are not evenly distributed to daughter cells during cell division. As a result, a daughter cell will lack the acentric fragment and deleterious consequences could occur.

Chromosome-breaking events can also generate acentric chromosomes or acentric fragments.

Dicentric

A dicentric chromosome is an abnormal chromosome with two centromeres. It is formed through the fusion of two chromosome segments, each with a centromere, resulting in the loss of acentric fragments (lacking a centromere) and the formation of dicentric fragments. The formation of dicentric chromosomes has been attributed to genetic processes, such as Robertsonian translocation and paracentric inversion. Dicentric chromosomes have important roles in the mitotic stability of chromosomes and the formation of pseudodicentric chromosomes.

Monocentric

The monocentric chromosome is a chromosome that has only one centromere in a chromosome and forms a narrow constriction.

Monocentric centromeres are the most common structure on highly repetitive DNA in plants and animals.

Holocentric

Unlike monocentric chromosomes, in holocentric chromosomes the entire length of the chromosome acts as the centromere. In holocentric chromosomes there is not one primary constriction but the centromere has many CenH3 loci spread over the whole chromosome. Examples of this type of centromere can be found scattered throughout the plant and animal kingdoms, with the most well-known example being the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.

**Title:** Chromatid
**URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatid?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral
**Source:** valyu/valyu-wikipedia

**Content:**
A chromatid (Greek khrōmat- 'color' + -id) is one half of a duplicated chromosome. Before replication, one chromosome is composed of one DNA molecule. In replication, the DNA molecule is copied, and the two molecules are known as chromatids. During the later stages of cell division these chromatids separate longitudinally to become individual chromosomes.

Chromatid pairs are normally genetically identical, and said to be homozygous. However, if mutations occur, they will present slight differences, in which case they are heterozygous. The pairing of chromatids should not be confused with the ploidy of an organism, which is the number of homologous versions of a chromosome.

Sister chromatids

Chromatids may be sister or non-sister chromatids. A sister chromatid is either one of the two chromatids of the same chromosome joined together by a common centromere. A pair of sister chromatids is called a dyad. Once sister chromatids have separated (during the anaphase of mitosis or the anaphase II of meiosis during sexual reproduction), they are again called chromosomes, each having the same genetic mass as one of the individual chromatids that made up its parent. The DNA sequence of two sister chromatids is completely identical (apart from very rare DNA copying errors).

Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) is the exchange of genetic information between two sister chromatids.  SCEs can occur during mitosis or meiosis.  SCEs appear to primarily reflect DNA recombinational repair processes responding to DNA damage (see articles Sister chromatids and Sister chromatid exchange).

Non-sister chromatids, on the other hand, refers to either of the two chromatids of paired homologous chromosomes, that is, the pairing of a paternal chromosome and a maternal chromosome. In chromosomal crossovers, non-sister (homologous) chromatids form chiasmata to exchange genetic material during the prophase I of meiosis (See Homologous chromosome pair).

## INTRODUCTION

Chromosome is the main carrier of genetic information, and is responsible for the transmission of genetic materials from parents to offspring. The number of chromosomes found in natural eukaryotic species ranges from one to thousands (15; 24). In most eukaryotic cells, chromosomes appear as chromatin during the interphase of the cell cycle and as linear “rods” during the mitotic phase (3). For a chromosome to function stably and effectively across generations, it must have a centromere and two telomeres. Centromere is a specific locus on a chromosome for assembly of the kinetochore, which is responsible for microtubule attachment and precise chromosome segregation during cell division (8), while telomeres are the physical ends of a chromosome that protect chromosome from degradation (1; 39).

Chromosomes do not seem to be randomly distributed or intermingled with each other in the nucleus. Instead, each chromosome occupies a distinct spatial volume in the interphase nucleus, called chromosome territory (12; 13; 26; 35). In addition, the territory of a particular chromosome may be different in different cell types (11; 14; 35). Accordingly, a proximal positioning of adjacent chromosomes may also be meaningful, e.g. regulating chromatin activities (5; 50; 53). But what determines chromosome territory and how it regulates genome function are unclear.

The chromosome number in naturally evolved house mice *Mus musculus domesticus*, which have populated in Western Europe and North Africa, ranges from 2n=40 to 2n=22 (7; 36; 41). Some of their chromosomes are metacentric, i.e. the centromere is at the middle of each chromosome due to fusions of two telocentric chromosomes, which are commonly found in the laboratory mouse (e.g. C57BL/6) (19). In addition, Muntjac deer (Muntiacus, Muntiacinae, Cervidae) have evolved quite diverse karyotypes (e.g. 2n = 46 of *M. reevesi* and 2n = 6/7 of *M. muntjak vaginalis*) through chromosome translocation, tandem fusion, and pericentric inversion (18; 37; 59). Recently, deliberate artificial chromosome engineering has succeeded in generating single-chromosomal *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* strains, which shows drastic changes in global chromosome structures, but grow as robustly as the naturally evolved strains (21; 29; 47). These lines of evidence suggest that chromosome architecture in eukaryotes is highly resilient, and chromosome territories could be self-organizing representations of the genome, or simply be a manifestation of random chromatin collisions driven by intrinsic interactions between chromatin loci and/or geometric constraints within the nucleus.

In order to experimentally address whether the high plasticity of chromosome architecture is a ubiquitous characteristic of eukaryotic genomes, we employed haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs) and mouse models to test the effects of extreme chromosome territory changes on stem cell pluripotency, cell fate determination and mouse development.

**Content:**
DNA normally exists as a double-stranded molecule, coiled into the shape of a double helix. Each nucleotide in DNA preferentially pairs with its partner nucleotide on the opposite strand: A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. Thus, in its two-stranded form, each strand effectively contains all necessary information, redundant with its partner strand. This structure of DNA is the physical basis for inheritance: DNA replication duplicates the genetic information by splitting the strands and using each strand as a template for synthesis of a new partner strand.

Genes are arranged linearly along long chains of DNA base-pair sequences. In bacteria, each cell usually contains a single circular genophore, while eukaryotic organisms (such as plants and animals) have their DNA arranged in multiple linear chromosomes. These DNA strands are often extremely long; the largest human chromosome, for example, is about 247 million base pairs in length. The DNA of a chromosome is associated with structural proteins that organize, compact, and control access to the DNA, forming a material called chromatin; in eukaryotes, chromatin is usually composed of nucleosomes, segments of DNA wound around cores of histone proteins. The full set of hereditary material in an organism (usually the combined DNA sequences of all chromosomes) is called the genome.

DNA is most often found in the nucleus of cells, but Ruth Sager helped in the discovery of nonchromosomal genes found outside of the nucleus. In plants, these are often found in the chloroplasts and in other organisms, in the mitochondria. These nonchromosomal genes can still be passed on by either partner in sexual reproduction and they control a variety of hereditary characteristics that replicate and remain active throughout generations.

While haploid organisms have only one copy of each chromosome, most animals and many plants are diploid, containing two of each chromosome and thus two copies of every gene. The two alleles for a gene are located on identical loci of the two homologous chromosomes, each allele inherited from a different parent.

Many species have so-called sex chromosomes that determine the gender of each organism. In humans and many other animals, the Y chromosome contains the gene that triggers the development of the specifically male characteristics. In evolution, this chromosome has lost most of its content and also most of its genes, while the X chromosome is similar to the other chromosomes and contains many genes. This being said, Mary Frances Lyon discovered that there is X-chromosome inactivation during reproduction to avoid passing on twice as many genes to the offspring. Lyon's discovery led to the discovery of other things including X-linked diseases. The X and Y chromosomes form a strongly heterogeneous pair.

Reproduction

When cells divide, their full genome is copied and each daughter cell inherits one copy. This process, called mitosis, is the simplest form of reproduction and is the basis for asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction can also occur in multicellular organisms, producing offspring that inherit their genome from a single parent. Offspring that are genetically identical to their parents are called clones.

Eukaryotic organisms often use sexual reproduction to generate offspring that contain a mixture of genetic material inherited from two different parents. The process of sexual reproduction alternates between forms that contain single copies of the genome (haploid) and double copies (diploid). Haploid cells fuse and combine genetic material to create a diploid cell with paired chromosomes. Diploid organisms form haploids by dividing, without replicating their DNA, to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of chromosomes. Most animals and many plants are diploid for most of their lifespan, with the haploid form reduced to single cell gametes such as sperm or eggs.

Although they do not use the haploid/diploid method of sexual reproduction, bacteria have many methods of acquiring new genetic information. Some bacteria can undergo conjugation, transferring a small circular piece of DNA to another bacterium. Bacteria can also take up raw DNA fragments found in the environment and integrate them into their genomes, a phenomenon known as transformation. These processes result in horizontal gene transfer, transmitting fragments of genetic information between organisms that would be otherwise unrelated. Natural bacterial transformation occurs in many bacterial species, and can be regarded as a sexual process for transferring DNA from one cell to another cell (usually of the same species). Transformation requires the action of numerous bacterial gene products, and its primary adaptive function appears to be repair of DNA damages in the recipient cell.

Recombination and genetic linkage

The diploid nature of chromosomes allows for genes on different chromosomes to assort independently or be separated from their homologous pair during sexual reproduction wherein haploid gametes are formed. In this way new combinations of genes can occur in the offspring of a mating pair. Genes on the same chromosome would theoretically never recombine. However, they do, via the cellular process of chromosomal crossover. During crossover, chromosomes exchange stretches of DNA, effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes. This process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis, a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells. Meiotic recombination, particularly in microbial eukaryotes, appears to serve the adaptive function of repair of DNA damages.

The first cytological demonstration of crossing over was performed by Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock in 1931. Their research and experiments on corn provided cytological evidence for the genetic theory that linked genes on paired chromosomes do in fact exchange places from one homolog to the other.

The probability of chromosomal crossover occurring between two given points on the chromosome is related to the distance between the points. For an arbitrarily long distance, the probability of crossover is high enough that the inheritance of the genes is effectively uncorrelated. For genes that are closer together, however, the lower probability of crossover means that the genes demonstrate genetic linkage; alleles for the two genes tend to be inherited together. The amounts of linkage between a series of genes can be combined to form a linear linkage map that roughly describes the arrangement of the genes along the chromosome.

Gene expression

Genetic code

Genes generally express their functional effect through the production of proteins, which are complex molecules responsible for most functions in the cell. Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains, each of which is composed of a sequence of amino acids, and the DNA sequence of a gene (through an RNA intermediate) is used to produce a specific amino acid sequence. This process begins with the production of an RNA molecule with a sequence matching the gene's DNA sequence, a process called transcription.

This messenger RNA molecule then serves to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence through a process called  translation. Each group of three nucleotides in the sequence, called a codon, corresponds either to one of the twenty possible amino acids in a protein or an instruction to end the amino acid sequence; this correspondence is called the genetic code. The flow of information is unidirectional: information is transferred from nucleotide sequences into the amino acid sequence of proteins, but it never transfers from protein back into the sequence of DNA—a phenomenon Francis Crick called the central dogma of molecular biology.

## INTRODUCTION

In each species, *x* is the basic (monoploid) chromosome number, *n* is the gametic chromosome number and 2*n* is the zygotic or somatic chromosome number. For example, barley (*Hordeum vulgare*) has 2*n* = 2*x* = 14 chromosomes (RR genome) in each somatic cell, common wheat (*Triticum aestivum*) has 2*n* = 6*x* = 42 chromosomes constituting AABBDD genome and potato (*Solanum tuberosum*) has 2*n* = 4*x* = 48 chromosomes in each cell. In wheat and barley, the basic chromosome number *x* is seven while *x* in potato is 12. The coefficient of *x* shows ploidy level and 2*n* represents somatic or sporophytic (diploid multicellular stage of the life cycle of a plant or alga) chromosome number in a species. Hence, barley is a diploid (2*x*) with RR genome, common wheat is an allohexaploid (6*x*) with three AA, BB, and DD subgenomes and potato is an autotetraploid (4*x*) with AAAA genome.

Most species have monocentric chromosomes each with a localized centromere that divides the chromosome into small (S or p) and large (L or q) arms, even the centromere can be terminal. However, some species have holocentric chromosomes that lack localized centromere (19). In addition to the essential chromosomes, supernumerary B chromosomes (Bs) may additionally be observed in some species. Bs are not essential and their number varies between different individuals from 0, 1, 2, 3, or even more (4; 18).

In the case of allopolyploid plants, homoeologous relationships are also considered for karyotyping. Homoeologous chromosomes are chromosomes in the same species that originated by speciation and were brought back together in the same genome by allopolyploidization. Homoeologous chromosomes are commonly determined based on the previous studies of the meiotic behavior of the chromosomes or physical mapping of the homoeologous genes or sequences on the chromosomes.

Each species has a typical karyotype, which represents the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes including number, size, and morphology (17). Karyogram is the specific representation of homologous chromosome pairs from a metaphase chromosome picture where chromosomes are arranged in descending order. Idiogram is a diagrammatic representation of the chromosomes showing their relative size, homologous groups and varieties of chromosomal landmarks such as centromeres and banding patterns. Idiograms are used in many journal articles on a regular basis and in web interfaces to visualize varieties of genome and chromosomal information.

Karyotype analysis is an essential component of many cytogenetic investigations that involve measurement of karyotypic asymmetry indices and chromosomal characteristics such as number, size, position, and type of landmarks such as centromeres, secondary constrictions, and tandem DNA patterns (11). This information then may be used to distinguish homologous chromosomes and understanding the chromosomal and karyotypic evolution. By comparing the chromosomes of different taxa much can be learned about patterns and mechanisms of karyotype evolution and its significance for diversification and speciation (30).

A lot of karyotype analyses have dealt with characteristics such as C- or N-banding patterns (7), *in situ* hybridization (ISH) banding patterns of repeated sequences (Lapitan *et al*. 1989; Albini and Schwarzacher 1992; Pedersen *et al*. 1996; Schrader *et al*. 1997), ISH of single-copy sequences (Shen *et al*. 1987; Peterson *et al*. 1999), or immunofluorescent localization of proteins on chromosomes (Anderson et al. 1999). The size and location of such landmarks are often quantifiable and are reflected in idiograms.

The traditional chromosomal measurement of different metaphase spreads and bringing the related data into tables is a slow and tedious process requiring intermediate photographic steps, manual statistical analysis, and manual drawing of the idiogram image. Interest in applying automation to the analysis of metaphase chromosomes dates back four decades and several computer applications have been developed so far to facilitate the accuracy of karyotype analyses (3; 5; 6; 8; 9; 13; 15; 21). Some packages are also published for drawing the idiograms in R such as RIdeogram (10) and idiogramFISH (24). Currently, tolls such as MircoMeasure (23), KaryoType (1), IdeoKar (20), ChromosomeJ plugin (28) and, DRAWID (14) are popularly used for the collection and analysis of cytogenetic data.

Here, we introduce our newly developed karyotyping tool called KaryoMeasure which is user-friendly and more flexible than our previously developed software: IdeoKar (20). KaryoMeasure is a software that facilitates chromosomal measurements and builds idiograms from digital images. KaryoMeasure is a semi-automated software and its use requires chromosome identification and numbering before karyotype analysis. In addition to extracting chromosomal and karyotypic parameters, KaryoMeasure is designed to additionally generate high-quality colored idiograms in vector-based PDF or SVG formats (Figure 1).

### OVERALL SOFTWARE DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE

KaryoMeasure software is used for the calculation of chromosomal and karyotypic parameters and to build idiograms. For this, a project is created at first, in which chromosome pictures are uploaded for karyotype analysis or idiogram generation via the ‘Image’ button in the menu bar. In this way, the pictures and upcoming activities on the pictures are automatically saved to the project so it is possible to continue analysis later after closing and reopening the project. Chromosomal and karyotypic parameters represented in Figure 1, are extracted by KaryoMeasure. The nomenclature used for the description of type or morphology of monocentric chromosomes is that proposed by 16 in which the chromosome type is defined based on the mean of arm ratio (Figure 2). Stebbin’s asymmetry index is according to Figure 3.

**Figure 1**: Using KaryoMeasure to trace extract karyotype parameters or generating idiograms. Images added to the project for karyotype analysis or Ideogram Generation are listed under Karyotype Analysis (**1**) and Ideogram Generation (**2**), respectively. After manual chromosome tracing, karyotypic parameters can be extracted (**3**) and idiograms can be generated (**4**). After reopening a project and selecting an image, it is possible to undo the latest drawn segment and/or continue from the latest point on the active image (**5**). If the latest point is a chromosome end, clicking on the ‘Continue from last segment’ key, reopens the end so that one can continue that chromosome. If you want to start a new chromosome, the previous chromosomes should be closed first because clicking on the ‘Continue from last segment’ key has already opened its end.
