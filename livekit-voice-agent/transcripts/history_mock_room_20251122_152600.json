        "Research complete. By mid-2025, China emerged as a leader in the global open-source large language model (LLM) landscape, with Chinese state media reporting that the country produced 1,509 of the approximately 3,755 publicly available LLMs worldwide. This surge in development has garnered notable endorsements, such as Airbnb's preference for Alibaba's Qwen over ChatGPT for customer service applications due to its superior speed. Additionally, new models like Kimi K2 Thinking, developed by Moonshot AI, have set benchmarks in reasoning, coding, and agent capabilities, reflecting significant advancements by Chinese AI firms in closing the performance gap with their international counterparts. Overall, these findings highlight the rapid evolution and competitive nature of China's AI sector in the global arena. The full results have been saved and are available."
