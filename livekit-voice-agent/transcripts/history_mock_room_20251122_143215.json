You're interested in research about large language models that have around four billion parameters—small compared to huge models like GPT-4.\n\nTo help you best, could you specify what aspects you want to focus on?

        "Understood! From now on, after your initial request, I'll ask all needed clarifying questions at once to understand your requirements fully before proceeding with research. \n\nTo try this out with your current topic on 4-billion parameter language models, here are a few questions to cover it all at once:\n\n1. Which specific details are you interested in? (e.g., architecture, training methods, performance, applications)\n2. Do you want recent research papers, industry examples, or both?\n3. Any preference on model types? (e.g., decoder-only like GPT, encoder-decoder like T5)\n4. Are you focusing on open-source models or commercial/proprietary ones?\n5. Do you want comparisons with larger or smaller models?\n6. Any target use case or domain you're focusing on?\n\nOnce I have your answers, I’ll start the research and keep the summary brief and clear. How does that sound?"
