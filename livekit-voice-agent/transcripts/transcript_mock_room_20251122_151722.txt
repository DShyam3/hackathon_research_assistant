[2025-11-22 15:17:57] ASSISTANT: I’ll start by researching the latest information on AI agents and the best frameworks for orchestrating them. To tailor the research to your needs, could you clarify the following:

1. Are you interested in AI agents in a specific domain (e.g., conversational agents, autonomous systems, multi-agent systems)?
2. Do you prefer information focused on academic research, industry applications, or open-source frameworks?
3. Are there particular features or capabilities you want in the orchestration frameworks (e.g., scalability, ease of integration, real-time processing)?

Your answers will help me provide the most relevant and up-to-date information.
