[2025-11-22 13:43:46] ASSISTANT: Thanks for clarifying! For consumer hardware aiming to run large language models (LLMs), some of the latest AI chips focus on enabling on-device inference with efficiency and speed. A few notable examples as of mid-2024 include:

1. **Apple M2 Pro and M2 Max** – These chips feature Neural Engines optimized for ML tasks, including running LLMs locally with good power efficiency, especially in MacBooks.

2. **NVIDIA RTX 40-series GPUs** – While often used in desktops, these GPUs (like the RTX 4090) are popular for accelerating LLM inference on high-end consumer machines.

3. **Google Tensor G3** (in Pixel 8 phones) – Tailored for edge AI workloads, it includes specialized ML accelerators to handle models like LLMs efficiently on mobile.

4. **Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3** – Integrated AI accelerators allow smartphones to run smaller or optimized LLMs on-device.

Are you interested in recommendations for a specific device type (e.g., laptop, smartphone), or more details on how these chips handle LLMs?
